      " Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) jumped on Tuesday, rising 6.5% as of 11:10 a.m. EST. The gain follows one analyst's decision to significantly increase his 12-month price target for the stock based on the company's recent execution and his expectations for more sharp sales growth from the electric-car company in the coming years. Image source: The Motley Fool. New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu gave Tesla stock an $800 12-month price target on Tuesday. This is up from his previous 12-month price target of $530. Supporting the stock's 80% gain over the last year has been the company's \"technological dominance, strong sustained demand, Tesla's ability to execute,\" said Ferragu in a note to investors.  Looking ahead, Ferragu thinks Tesla's annual deliveries can increase from a run rate of about 450,000 today to 2 million to 3 million units by 2025. In addition, the analyst believes the company will boast \"industry leading margins.\" Tesla stock's wild gain recently means investors will be watching closely when the automaker reports fourth-quarter results on Jan. 29. Investors will be looking for another profitable quarter and guidance for more strong growth in deliveries in 2020.

      " Top Energy Stocks XOM\t-1.09% CVX\t-0.77% COP\t-2.03% SLB\t-2.19% OXY\t-0.60% Energy stocks retreated Wednesday after US President Donald Trump said Iran appears to be standing down following missile attacks overnight on two airbases in Iraq housing US troops, cooling worries over escalating military responses in the region. The NYSE Energy index was off about 1.3% this afternoon while the shares of energy companies in the S&P 500 also were down over 1.2% as a group. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled $3.09 lower at $60.44 per barrel, sinking almost 5%, while the global benchmark Brent crude contract declined $2.60 to $65.67 per barrel. Natural gas futures fell 2 cents to $2.14 per 1 million BTU. In industry news: US commercial crude oil inventories rose for the first time in four weeks, also weighing on commodity prices, with the Energy Information Administration Wednesday reporting a 1.2 million barrel increase during the seven days ended Jan. 3. That compares with a 3.7 million-barrel decline expected by industry experts polled by S&P Global Platts and the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reportedly saying supplies fell 5.95 million barrels last week. Among energy stocks moving on news: (+) Consol Energy (CEIX) bottomed out this afternoon, dropping 6.6% in late trade. The thermal coal miner Wednesday said it acquired a 25% equity stake in a West Virginia-based manufacturer of carbon foam products, with the $3.5 million deal marking its first investment in the coal-to-products space. Consol also agreed to provide CFOAM Ltd with a $1.1 million term-loan facility for working capital and acquired a $400,000ll first-lien note from an existing creditor. In other sector news: (-) Occidental Petroleum (OXY) was down almost 1% in Wednesday trade. Mizuho Securities earlier raised its investment recommendation on the energy major to buy from neutral and also increased its price target on the company's stock by $14 to $58 a share. (-) Nabors Industries (NBR) slid over 2% after the drill rig operator late Tuesday priced a $1 billion private placement of new debt, consisting of $600 million 7.25% senior guaranteed notes due 2026 and $400 million 7.5% senior guaranteed notes due 2028. Net proceeds will be used to repurchase up to $800 million of its existing senior debt maturing later this year and in 2021 and 2023. Remaining monies will fund general corporate purposes. (-) NexTier Oilfield Solutions (NEX) fell nearly 6%. The well completion services company overnight raised the range of its Q4 revenue forecast to a range of $640 million to $660 million, up from its prior call projecting between $600 million to $650 million and now exceeding the Capital IQ consensus of $626.4 million in revenue during the three months ended Dec. 31.

      " (RTTNews) - Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) and Western Midstream Partners LP (WES) announced the execution of several agreements that enable WES to operate as an independent midstream company. The executed agreements include amendments to the limited partnership agreement that significantly expand unitholders' rights, including the right to remove and replace Occidental as the general partner. The amendments included the transfer of the WES corporate officers' employment from Occidental to the Partnership. Occidental said it will no longer consolidate WES's statement of operations, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.  Occidental Petroleum, in an update on its execution of key strategic and financial initiatives following the close of its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, said it plans to continue its operational relationship with WES and expects to maintain a significant economic interest in WES, which Occidental will reduce to below 50% during 2020. Occidental noted that it will provide limited administrative services to WES for up to two years. Occidental said it continues to make progress towards meeting its $15 billion divestiture target, with the recently announced sale of $565 million of Houston and Woodlands real estate assets to the Howard Hughes Corporation. Western Midstream Partners expects 2020 Adjusted EBITDA between $1.875 billion and $1.975 billion and 2020 total capital expenditures between $875 million and $950 million.

      " Top Energy Stocks XOM\t+1.37% CVX\t+0.21% COP\t+1.68% SLB\t+1.17% OXY\t+3.70% Energy stocks continued to add to their mid-day gains, with the NYSE Energy Sector Index climbing almost 1.6% in late trade while the shares of energy companies in the S&P 500 were up more than 1.2% as a group. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 22 cents higher at $63.27 per barrel while the global benchmark Brent crude contract was ahead 17 cents to $68.77 per barrel after earlier touching a day high of $70.74. Natural gas futures rose 1 cent to $2.14 per 1 million BTU. Among energy stocks moving on news: (+) Laredo Petroleum (LPI) jumped over 6% on Monday after the oil and natural gas producer topped its FY19 production estimates, averaging around 80,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 19% over prior-year levels. Oil production grew about 2% year-over-year in FY18 to 28,400 barrels per day while its proved oil reserves increased 27% at year's end compared with FY18. In other sector news: (+) Western Midstream Partners (WES) rose almost 4% on Monday after saying Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has executed several agreements that will enable the natural gas pipeline and gathering company to fully operate as a stand-alone business and pursue third-party opportunities while also continuing its work for Occidental. Occidental also will provide $20 million in cash to Western Midstream before the end of March to help defray likely transition costs. (+) Superior Energy Services (SPN) turned more than 1% lower, reversing a 4% mid-day gain after saying its Q4 revenue will likely drop between 10% to 15% compared with the prior quarter's $325.9 million. The new projection is down from its prior call looking for a 5% to 10% sequential decline and follows what the company says is a worse-than-expected cut in the US land rig count. (-) Flotek Industries (FTK) slid more than 10% on Monday. The oilfield-services firm selected John Gibson Jr to be its new CEO, succeeding John Chisholm. Gibson also was named board chairman, succeeding David Nierenberg, who will remain an independent director while Chisholm has stepped down from the board.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n",

After a rough last five years of revamping its portfolio in an effort to adjust to the new reality of $50 to $70 oil, will Exxon be able to turn it around or will the next five years bring similar results?  XOM data by YCharts On paper, Exxon's stock looks pretty attractive. A price-to-earnings ratio of 20 and a 5 percent dividend yield place Exxon among both value stocks and dividend stocks, but the company is in growth mode, too. Image Source: Getty Images. In March, ExxonMobil announced its plans to \"accelerate Permian output to 1 million barrels per day by 2024.\" The Permian Basin is the nation's hottest shale play, producing nearly 5 million barrels per day, which is more than a third of total U.S. output and nearly half of U.S. onshore production. Exxon's announcement included the following takeaways: Exxon's quest comes at a steep cost. The energy stock was able to have such a massive increase in 2018 Permian production thanks to a $6.6 billion purchase of acreage in 2017. Since then, Exxon has continued to expand its Permian operations, and according to Argus Media, which tracks global energy business, \"unconventional output rose by 72% from a year earlier to 293,000 BOE/D [barrels of oil equivalent per day] in the third quarter of 2019.\" Meanwhile, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is on track to raise its Permian output to 900,000 BOE/D by 2023.  Aside from its Permian focus, ExxonMobil's 45% stake in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana is another multi-billion dollar investment. ExxonMobil expects the Stabroek Block to produce 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025, bolstered by up to 120,000 barrels of production from the Liza Phase 1 development starting in 2020. ExxonMobil began producing oil from its Liza Destiny floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) in December.  In addition to Guyana, Exxon is making multi-billion dollar investments in the growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that 50 countries will be importing LNG by 2025, up from 10 at the start of the century.Exxon is the operator of the $19 billion Papa New Guinea LNG Project, the operations of which have the capacity to produce over 8 million tonnes of LNG annually. In terms of other LNG projects, Exxon is ramping up investment in the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique. Recently announced in October 2019, the company plans to invest more than $500 million in the initial construction phase of the project which now has a capacity of over 15 million tonnes of LNG annually.  Exxon has also made bids for the \"pre-salt\" offshore blocks off the coast of Brazil, one of the largest discoveries over the past few decades. For the time being, uncertainty surrounds Exxon's involvement in these offshore blocks after the November 2019 asset auction went bust.  There's been a running theme for the large integrated oil and gas company: Divest away from stodgy, long-term payoff plays and into quick returns now available in the shale basins throughout the United States. For Exxon, the divestments are fairly extreme, totaling $4.8 billion against $8.7 billion in earnings, and capital expenditures of $22.7 billion as of the nine months ended Sept. 30.  Exxon operates a system from the wellhead to your car in an effort to balance the risks associated with just exploring for and producing hydrocarbons or solely refining them. The upstream side of oil and gas is typically termed a commodity business, whereas the downstream side is a margin game based on the lowest input cost for a barrel of oil and the highest output of gasoline and distillates. In early September 2019, the number of onshore operating drilling rigs in the United States fell below 900 for the first time since 2017. Today, the rig count is 800, more or less. The Baker Hughes Rig Count acts as a yardstick for onshore drilling contractors, which Exxon hires to drill new wells. Despite a trend of fewer rigs, Exxon has 55 operational rigs in the Permian Basin as of the third quarter of 2019, up from 51 in the second quarter and 46 in the first quarter. But that's just the upstream side. In addition to its rising upstream portfolio, Exxon has the second-largest refining capacity in the world. When crude prices are down, Exxon's refinery margins improve since low-priced Permian oil can feed cheaply and efficiently into Exxon's vast downstream refining infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. In terms of downstream growth, Exxon is currently developing 18 refining and petrochemical facilities. Next year, ExxonMobil will celebrate the 150-year anniversary of its predecessor, Standard Oil. In five years, Exxon plans to become one of the largest producers (if not the largest one) out of the Permian Basin. On the flip side, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), the world's largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, unveiled a 10-year savings and operations plan that reflects tighter spending in an effort to increase investor confidence by rewarding shareholders with strong dividends built upon consistent free cash flow. ConocoPhillips lowered its capital expenditure budget to roughly $7 billion per year through 2029. Total cash flow generation is expected to be $50 billion with a 3% annual output growth based on \"a real West Texas Intermediate price of $50 per barrel.\"   In addition to ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) is also cutting spending in an effort to deleverage its balance sheet after its acquisition of Anadarko. Occidental also estimated that its capital budget will decrease from $9.0 billion in 2019 to somewhere in the $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion range in 2020, which is expected to generate production growth of 2% in the year. Tying it all together, ExxonMobil is raising money from divestments to fund Permian Basin expansion projects aimed at producing hydrocarbons quickly and at a low cost that it can then feed into its immense refinery network. The company's quick return Permian assets aim to pair nicely with its large offshore projects and focus on LNG. Exxon should be able to make these investments while raising its dividend, as it has done for 37 consecutive years. The company has increased its dividend by more than 100% in the past 10 years alone. In sum, Exxon and Chevron could be able to pull ahead from independents like ConocoPhillips and Occidental as spending tightens for E&Ps. Although the last five years were tough on Exxon, it seems the company has adjusted well to the new energy environment and could have a bright future.  10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobilWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " There's a good reason that Wall Street and investors follow Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett like a hawk: his incredible track record. Since the mid-1950s, Buffett has managed to turn $10,000 in seed investment capital into a personal net worth of more than $89 billion. And keep in mind, this doesn't take into account the tens of billions of dollars Buffett has donated throughout the years. He's also created an incredible amount of value for his shareholders, with Berkshire Hathaway's share price appreciation leading to more than $400 billion in wealth creation for investors over the long run. The big question often is, \"What's Buffett going to buy next?\" Rather than contemplate which of the more than 3,000 publicly traded stocks he could choose to invest in next, let's consider the very real possibility that he could add to one or more of his existing 48 holdings. After all, Berkshire Hathaway does have a record $128.2 billion in cash on hand. This year, I'll be looking for the Oracle of Omaha to use some of his cash pile to add to following three positions. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett at his company's annual shareholder meeting. Image source: The Motley Fool. Call it the biggest surprise of 2019, but Berkshire Hathaway opened a position in Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) for the first time ever. At 537,300 shares currently, Amazon accounts for $1 billion in value of Berkshire's $251.6 billion investment portfolio. Interestingly, it wasn't Buffett himself who dipped his toes into the pond with Amazon. Rather, he credited one of his investment lieutenants for the purchase. These money managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, are also free to make investments using Berkshire's cash on hand.  Amazon offers two particular attributes that are liable to attract Buffett, and especially his investment managers. First, there's the company's dominance in e-commerce, which is driven, in part, by its Prime memberships. Aside from offering consumers perks, Prime most importantly keeps users loyal to the brand in a highly competitive retail landscape. According to eMarketer, in June, Amazon was on track to account for 38% of all U.S. e-commerce sales in 2019. Second, there's Amazon's under-the-radar giant, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud services platform. It was predominantly targeted at small and medium-size businesses, but has become a go-to cloud platform for companies of all sizes. AWS' sales growth is currently more than double that of e-commerce, with cloud computing margins also considerably higher than the company's retail operations. Thus, as AWS grows as a percentage of sales, operating income and cash flow for Amazon should soar. You might think Amazon is \"expensive,\" but after being valued at an average of 30 times full-year cash flow over the past five years, the company is now valued at a mere 20 times Wall Street's estimated 2020 cash flow and just over 11 times 2022's estimated cash flow. Amazon is a reasonably inexpensive stock, and I believe that'll lead to Buffett and his team adding to the position in 2020. Image source: Getty Images. Feel free to call this one the \"no duh\" of likely additions in 2020, but expect Warren Buffett to add to his recently opened position in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). During the third quarter, Berkshire acquired nearly 7.5 million shares of Occidental, which are currently worth about $343 million. This represents a relatively small 0.3% stake of Occidental's outstanding share count. The real catalyst here that's likely to get Buffett even more involved is the $10 billion he committed to Occidental Petroleum in April to aid in the acquisition of Anadarko, which had received a competing bid from oil and gas giant Chevron. But the monster financial backing offered by Buffett appears to be one of a few factors that allowed Occidental to be the winner of the buyout sweepstakes. In return for the $10 billion investment, Buffett received preferred stock in Occidental, as well as warrants that would allow for the purchase of as many as 80 million shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $62.50.  Following the investment, Occidental's share price proceeded to lose more than 30% of its value by early December, offering Buffett and his team a perceived discount. Buffett has, historically, favored downdrafts in stocks he's purchased, as it gives him and his team an opportunity to build a substantive position in a wonderful company at a fair price. As long as Occidental remains well below where Buffett initially took his stake, I'd have to believe the lure of betting on higher long-term oil prices by purchasing more shares of this integrated oil and gas company is very much on the table. Image source: Getty Images. Last, but not least, Buffett has long been a fan of money center banks, and his love affair with banks paid off big time in 2019. When the curtain closed, some of Buffett's favorite bank holdings, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, had registered gains of 41% and 42%, respectively. What's interesting, though, is that perhaps the most conservative and consistent bank of the bunch that Buffett owns, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), \"only\" gained 28%, thereby slightly underperforming the benchmark S&P 500. Throughout the years, Buffett has not been shy about adding to his stake in U.S. Bancorp, and I expect 2020 to be no different. A quick review of the company's most recent operating results shows it's still doing a lot right. U.S. Bancorp's return on assets was the highest among U.S. money center banks at 1.57% in the third quarter, with 8.1% year-over-year noninterest income growth. Furthermore, the company's loan portfolio continues to demonstrate stellar growth prospects. Total loan growth was 4% from the previous year in the third quarter, with residential mortgage loans increasing by 10.6% (a function of low lending rates), credit card loans up 8.8%, and commercial loans rising 5%.  U.S. Bancorp's continued focus on the bread-and-butter of banking (loans and deposits) is liable to keep this stock as a Buffett favorite. Look for him to add to his stake in 2020.  10 stocks we like better than AmazonWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Most analysts who make stock market predictions set them and then forget them. Few will publicly go back at the end of the year and review their forecasts, unless they happened to be spot on, in which case they'll want to trumpet their success. However, I believe in full transparency. That's why I'm reviewing all my stock selections for 2019. Among the ones I called the five top energy stocks to buy last year, there was a mix of winners and losers.  Image source: Getty Images. Natural gas driller Antero Resources (NYSE: AR) entered 2019 with high expectations. Because it had locked in the price for 100% of its natural gas output, the company expected to generate enough cash to grow its production by between 17% and 20% in 2019. Further, thanks to the monetization of some of its natural gas hedging contracts at the end of 2018 and the planned consolidation of its midstream entities, the company had started returning cash to investors via a $600 million share repurchase program.  Antero, however, would go on to produce abysmal results. While the price of both natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) tumbled last year -- which put pressure on Antero's balance sheet -- the main issue weighing on the stock was its burdensome pipeline commitments. The company needs to keep growing its production to fill up its pipeline capacity agreements. Because of that, it's burning through cash to increase its output. The company is working to address that issue by targeting to sell up to $1 billion in assets in 2020. While Antero believes it will be able to satisfy its pipeline commitments by 2022, investors are losing confidence in the company's ability to create value.  Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIP) -- which operates a portfolio of energy midstream, utility, transportation, and data infrastructure businesses -- delivered exceptional results in 2019. The company benefited from organic growth that came in above the high end of its 6% to 9% target range, as well as acquisitions. The transactions it closed during the year have it on track to exit 2019 with an annualized earnings run rate 17% higher than it was in mid-2018. Meanwhile, it has several more deals in the pipeline, positioning it to continue growing at an accelerated pace in 2020. Because of that, Brookfield Infrastructure stock could produce strong returns again this year. Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) generated a solid return for its investors in 2019. While the master limited partnership (MLP) underperformed the red-hot S&P 500, which gained 30% in 2019, it produced much higher total returns than the average energy stock. Fueling its big year was the success of its expansion program. Earnings have risen 14% over the past year, which allowed the MLP to continue increasing its dividend. Meanwhile, it secured several more expansion projects during 2019, which should give it plenty of fuel to keep growing both its cash flow and distribution over the next several years. Because of that, Enterprise Products Partners appears poised to continue generating market-beating total returns.  Image source: Getty Images. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) entered 2019 with renewed vigor. The oil and gas producer had just finished up its transformation program, which reduced its oil breakeven level to around $40 a barrel. Because of that, the company was on track to generate lots of cash, since oil started the year around $50 a barrel. However, instead of cashing in on those rising oil prices, Occidental went out a paid a significant premium to buy rival Anadarko Petroleum. The move saddled the company with lots of debt and infuriated its investors, which is why its stock slumped. As a result, the company faces an uphill battle in 2020 because it's struggling to sell assets to pay down debt, and has an activist investor pushing it to make changes.  TerraForm Power (NASDAQ: TERP) produced excellent results in 2019. The renewable energy company improved the profitability of its legacy assets while continuing to acquire new ones, even as it firmed up its financial foundation. Because of that, TerraForm has lots of momentum entering 2020. Its earnings should continue expanding, which should enable it to increase its dividend once again. Meanwhile, it has plenty of financial flexibility to make more acquisitions, which could provide additional boosts to its cash flow in the coming year. My two worst-performing energy stock picks for 2019 were both oil and gas producers. While commodity price volatility played a role in their underperformance, the biggest factor driving their abysmal stock returns was poor management. In both cases, the companies are pursuing aggressive growth strategies that added heavy debt to their balance sheets, weighing on their share prices. The lesson here is to avoid energy companies being led by management teams who will pursue growth at all costs. On a more positive note, I did well with energy companies that utilize lower-risk business models. Brookfield Infrastructure, Enterprise Products Partners, and TerraForm Power all primarily operate infrastructure that's backed by long-term contracts, which enables them to generate steadier cash flows. Those models have given them the funds to pay growing dividends as well as invest in expanding their portfolios. Because of that, I'm going to focus more of my attention in 2020 on picking energy stocks with similar qualities, since that should improve my odds of selecting winning investments. 10 stocks we like better than Enterprise Products PartnersWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) entered 2019 with loads of upside potential. The energy giant was coming off a transitional year during which it completed its cash-flow breakeven plan. As a result, it only needed oil to average $40 a barrel to support its operations and its high-yielding dividend. With crude starting the year well above that level, Occidental appeared poised to generate lots of excess cash. Indeed, it looked to me like the top oil stock to buy heading into 2019. However, instead of sitting back and watching the cash flow in as oil prices rose during the year, Occidental went on the offensive and paid a pretty penny to wrestle rival Anadarko Petroleum away from Chevron (NYSE: CVX). It was a move that infuriated shareholders as it added a substantial amount of debt to Occidental's balance sheet. That weight caused the stock to tumble 33% on the year. In the wake of that slump, the question now is whether Occidental has suffered enough, or if further declines could still be ahead. Image source: Getty Images. Occidental Petroleum laid out a whopping $55 billion for Anadarko, outbidding Chevron by $5 billion. However, in a relatively unusual move for a megamerger, Occidental didn't issue a lot of stock to finance the deal. To do that would have required a shareholder vote that it likely would have lost. Instead, it funded the majority of the transaction with cash -- $31.8 billion overall -- which meant taking on a substantial amount of debt.  Occidental aims to pay down that debt burden by selling between $10 billion and $15 billion in assets, and it has made significant progress on that front. \"We are highly confident that the actions we already have in progress will allow us to exceed the upper end of our original $10 [billion] to $15 billion divestiture goal by the middle of 2020,\" said CEO Vicki Hollob in a mid-November update. If everything goes according to plan, Occidental will significantly reduce its balance sheet issues, which should help lift the main weight holding down its stock.  In addition to that, oil prices have risen considerably over the past year. Crude ended 2019 up more than 35%, with U.S. benchmark WTI closing above $61 per barrel. If crude oil remains in its current neighborhood, the company should generate significantly more cash flow in the coming year, which it can use to support its dividend as well as further pay off debt.  Finally, the main reason Occidental bought Anadarko is that it believed that there were significant synergies to be found in combining the two companies' operations. Management expects to be able to cut out $3.5 billion of annual expenses by 2021. Progress toward that goal would help prove to skeptical investors that it made the right move.  Image source: Getty Images. While Occidental Petroleum still asserts that it can hit the high-end of its asset-sales target, the process has proved more complicated than initially expected. One major piece of the puzzle is the planned sale of Anadarko's African assets to French energy giant Total (NYSE: TOT). While the companies completed one part of the transaction, Occidental ran into a roadblock with the deal for Anadarko's Algerian assets; that country's national oil company is trying to block the transaction.  In addition to that, Occidental wanted to monetize some of its stake in Anadarko's former midstream arm, Western Midstream (NYSE: WES). However, a slump in Western's valuation forced Occidental to put the process on hold. While Western Midstream's valuation has bounced back a bit, it's still down 29% over the past year. This leaves Occidental with a dilemma -- either sell Western shares at a fire sale price, or fail to hit its assets-sales target. If it's the second option, investors' concerns over Occidental's financial profile would likely intensify, which could lead to a further slide in its share price.  Also, Occidental's fortunes naturally are tied to the price of oil. While crude was red hot last year, it could give back some of its gains in 2020 as new supply enters the market.  Either headwind would be bad for this energy company. But if both occur, it might need to slash its 7.7%-yielding dividend to shore up its finances. Add it all up, and more suffering could be ahead for Occidental's shareholders.  10 stocks we like better than Occidental PetroleumWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Everyone knows that Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) makes trucks, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) makes electric vehicles. But Rivian Automotive? What the heck is that? By the time 2020 is out, I suspect absolutely no one will be asking this question. If you haven't heard of Rivian Automotive yet, here's a quick rundown. Image source: Rivian Automotive. Based in Plymouth, Michigan, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence Rivian Automotive set up shop back in 2009 (although we didn't start hearing a lot about it until just last year). The company hasn't begun operations yet, really, but plans to begin selling its first two electric trucks, the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, in late 2020. Kelley Blue Book advises that both models will seat at least five passengers, with the R1S having an optional three-row, seven-passenger configuration. As all-electric vehicles, they will not have a gas engine -- but may not need one to allay consumers' range anxiety, because both vehicles will be rated for between 300 and 410 miles fully charged.   Because they're trucks, they'll boast significant towing capacity -- 11,000 pounds for the R1T and 7,700 pounds for the R1S. And because they're electric, they'll be able to go really fast when not towing a boat or camper -- accelerating from 0 to 60 in as little as three seconds. Neither truck will be cheap. Rivian expects to price the R1T at $69,000 to start, and the R1S at $72,500, both prices before state and federal tax credits. Now admittedly, none of this information will make much difference to consumers (or investors) if Rivian goes bust, or fails to produce the products it's promised. But recent financing rounds suggest that Rivian will in fact have the cash it needs to go the distance. Last year, for example, Rivian attracted a $700 million investment from a consortium led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which later awarded Rivian a contract to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans specially designed for Amazon's use. (Deliveries will begin in 2020 or 2021, and continue through 2024).   In swift succession, Rivian won a further $500 million investment from a company you'd think would consider it a rival -- Ford -- and $350 million from privately held Cox Automotive. Those investments alone probably would have been enough to make Rivian a viable contender to Tesla, which has an SUV of its own on the market already (Model X), and announced an electric pickup truck offering in November (Cybertruck). But in the waning days of December, Rivian won an even bigger investment -- more money than Ford and Amazon ponied up, combined. On Monday, December 23, Rivian announced it had secured a $1.3 billion investment from \"funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.\" With that money in hand, Rivian ended the year with nearly $3 billion in new funding. Given that the company already has a production plant to build in (Mitsubishi's old plant in Normal, Illinois), $3 billion should be just enough cash to develop the three closely related truck/van models revealed so far. According to autoblog.com, the average cost to develop new cars is about $1 billion per model.   Of course, the question still remains: Will Rivian's trucks sell? According to Wall Street Journal auto reporter Dan Neil, \"we are living through the S-curve of EV adoption,\" and 2020 could very well become the year of the electric \"car.\" That being said, there are going to be a lot of electric cars coming to market this year to choose from, with more than a dozen new models coming on line to compete with existing fare such as Tesla's Models S, 3, and X and Nissan's Leaf.   Although it's hard to keep track of all the moving parts, WSJ alone highlights Volvo's XC40 Recharge, Ford's Mustang Mach-E, and Mini's Mini Cooper SE as viable contenders in addition to Tesla's and Nissan's wares. At starting prices ranging from $60,500 (Ford) to just $30,750 (Mini), each of these new rivals underprices Rivian's offering.   One thing Rivian has got, however, that everyone else has not: Last week, Rivian released a video demonstrating its new \"tank turn\" feature that will be available for both the R1T and R1S. Like a modern main battle tank, the truck's four electric motors can spin in different directions, enabling the truck to literally turn on a dime -- spinning itself around a fixed point.   Probably thought up as a way to market the truck to off-roaders initially, this feature would also make Rivian's truck incredibly maneuverable in tight spaces, such as might be encountered on construction sites, in crowded driveways, and parking garages -- the latter perhaps a valuable selling point to suburban shoppers. Combined with the right software, I suspect Rivian's tank-turn feature will also make parallel parking in even the tightest spaces a breeze. Long story short, yes, this truck will sell. Now, all Rivian needs to do is build it.  10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Investing in a group of quality growth stocks and sticking with them for decades can lead to life-changing wealth. An investment of just $100 per month at an annualized return of 12% over 50 years can grow to $3.9 million.  Three stocks that can help you achieve those returns are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here's why these stocks should remain compounding machines for the next 50 years. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's Google is still benefiting from the shift of ad spending moving online. Its range of products and platforms, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, and Gmail, each have over one billion users. That's attractive to advertisers, and it's why Google is the No. 3 most valuable brand in the world, according to Brand Finance.  However, over the next 50 years, Alphabet will likely generate significant amounts of revenue from other businesses. The one analysts are watching heading into 2020 is Google Cloud. Google's \"other revenue\" that includes Google Cloud, Google Play, Google Home, and other hardware products has been Alphabet's fastest-growing segment in the last few years, and it may reach 20% of the company's total revenue in 2020.  There are not many companies as forward-thinking as Alphabet that have the resources to invest billions in new growth avenues. The company considers its investments in moonshot opportunities, or \"other bets,\" as vital to its future success. These other bets include potential world-changers, such as self-driving cars with Waymo, or growth opportunities in life sciences with Verily.  Don't let Alphabet's $992 billion market cap make you think the stock has already run its course. The company has more than doubled its revenue and earnings over the last five years, and given its forward-thinking corporate culture, Alphabet should continue to grow for many years. Moving one spot below Google on Brand Finance's most valuable brand list is Microsoft, at No. 4. The software giant has been making essential tools for people to get stuff done for decades. Microsoft has over 900 million Windows 10 users. Under CEO Sadya Nadella, the company has spread its reach well beyond the PC to mobile devices and the cloud. Microsoft has the brand recognition, network effect advantage, and resources to continue winning in the markets it serves. Its Office software is still in high demand after all these years. Even though Apple has 1.4 billion users of its devices, the familiarity people have with Apple's software hasn't dethroned Microsoft's Word and Excel. Office commercial products, including 365 subscriptions, have been growing fast, up 25% year over year in the most recent quarter.  Also, businesses are continuing to use cloud-based tools to handle IT services. The infrastructure-as-a-service cloud market is expected to grow three times faster than traditional IT services through 2022, according to Gartner. Microsoft Azure has tremendous momentum in this space, with revenue surging 59% year over year in the last quarter.  Microsoft has proven it can adapt its basic software services to the cloud and develop new cloud-based platforms for businesses, such as Dynamics 365 and Azure. The ability to adapt to changing environments in technology gives me confidence that the company will still be around in 50 years. It offers good growth prospects, high margins, and a growing stream of dividends. Owning the stock seems like a no-brainer for the 21st century. Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Tesla is not short of investor attention. The stock has experienced a meteoric rise since its initial public offering in 2010, but the sky truly is the limit for Elon Musk's company. Some on Wall Street are debating whether it's time to sell the stock after the share price more than doubled off of its lows last year. But I think long-term investors should stay the course, and if you don't already own shares, you should consider starting a small position. Tesla is at the center of a secular trend sweeping the world, as alternative forms of energy are increasingly in demand for everything from how homes are built to what fuels our cars. Tesla is known for its Model S, Model X, and Model 3 electric vehicles, but it defines its mission as helping the world accelerate to sustainable energy through various energy products, including solar electricity. The company has installed thousands of solar products for consumers since 2006, and last year, it released Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.  You can't underestimate a visionary leader like Musk, who has demonstrated a great talent for seeing an opportunity and starting a business to capture it. As Tesla approaches a $100 billion market cap, the company still has a tiny share of the nearly 100 million vehicles shipped in the industry every year. There were about 367,500 Tesla vehicles delivered in 2019, for an increase of 50% year over year. That growth is thanks to the Model 3, which went into production in 2017 and comes at a much more affordable price for the masses.  However, Musk believes the upcoming Model Y will outsell the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined. As Tesla releases more models, builds Gigafactories around the world, increases scale, and brings prices down for these cars, it's inevitable the company will hit the one-million delivery mark at some point. There is enormous upside for the Tesla brand over the next 50 years. All three stocks are already large caps, but each could keep heading higher from here. Consider that Coca-Cola started in 1886, but the stock is still increasing in value for shareholders. Walt Disney was started in 1923, but the stock is up 355% over the last 10 years. Great growth stocks continue to find ways to deliver returns for shareholders, and I believe Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla will be no different.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "  U.S. stocks saw a potentially concerning reversal on Friday. Declines werenÃ¢ÂÂt large Ã¢ÂÂ the S&P 500 closed down just 0.29% Ã¢ÂÂ but major indices finished the session at the lows.   To be sure, a modest intraday decline doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean the decade-long bull market is over. All three indices closed Thursday, once again, at new all-time highs, as the easing of tensions in the Middle East brought buyers back into the market. That said, FridayÃ¢ÂÂs trading adds to the sense that there are some modest concerns at the moment, or at least some risks to watch. Earnings season . Valuations do look potentially stretched after huge 2019 returns. Domestic political developments could impact sentiment as presidential primaries arrive. MondayÃ¢ÂÂs big stock charts feature three names for which those external considerations should impact trading going forward. All three stocks have managed to find a bottom in the last few months after pulling back Ã¢ÂÂ no surprise in an equity market making new all-time highs. All three charts show that strength can continue if these stocks can dodge some of the same risks that threaten the market as a whole.    Investors bought the dip in UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:), and with good reason. UNH stock has been one of the best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the past decade. Those who stepped in at early October lows are up nearly 40% since Ã¢ÂÂ but the first of MondayÃ¢ÂÂs big stock charts highlights a risk that the rally will stall out: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ UNH stock still sits modestly below December highs. And the narrowing ascending wedge pattern does present a risk of a reversal, particularly with shares threatening to slip out of that wedge. A downside exit would suggest a decline toward moving averages, with the 50-day providing initial support at $280 and the 200-day back down near $250 at the moment. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Fundamentally, UnitedHealth stock still looks attractive at 18x forward earnings. The  likely holds even just off all-time highs. But competitors are eyeing the companyÃ¢ÂÂs market share. And itÃ¢ÂÂs certainly fair to wonder if the looming U.S. presidential election will drive volatility in UNH stock in 2020 Ã¢ÂÂ or at least lead some investors to the sidelines until political clarity emerges. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ An investorÃ¢ÂÂs view of UNH, then, might well be driven by her view of the market as a whole. Political risk obviously isnÃ¢ÂÂt limited to UnitedHealth stock: elections could hover over stocks for the next ten months. On the other hand, this has been a market where investors have been rewarded for focusing on quality over valuation and for sticking with winners. If that trend holds, UNHÃ¢ÂÂs rally might have another leg ahead.    The second of our big stock charts, railroad operator CSX Corporation (NYSE:), also shows a bottom. And there is a technical case for the uptrend to continue: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ CSX stock has exited a triangle pattern to the upside, and sits nicely in the center of an uptrend that has held since late August. Moving averages look like they can provide near-term support. And a bullish golden cross could loom in the coming weeks: if CSX can keep rallying, the 50-day moving average should clear the 200-day.   Ã¢ÂÂ¢ Market factors will matter. Railroads are notoriously sensitive to the macroeconomic climate. If the market as a whole sells off, CSX stock likely will as well. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ As a result, CSX stock looks like an intriguing pick for macro bulls. The near-term technical outlook is positive. Valuation is attractive if external factors cooperate. And yet shares actually trade below where they did sixteen months ago. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a nice case that CSX stock should be able to catch up with the rest of the market, and even outperform other big railroad stocks like Union Pacific (NYSE:) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:).    It does look like the third of MondayÃ¢ÂÂs big stock charts has played out. For Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:), trading going forward will depend on whether the stock can break through resistance: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ OXY stock already has made its move. Shares have reversed out of a narrowing descending wedge and cleared moving averages. To be sure, thereÃ¢ÂÂs still a lot of ground left to cover: Occidental stock touched a 14-year low last month. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ The catalyst to the downside has been OxyÃ¢ÂÂs acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum. Occidental,  Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:,NYSE:BRK.B),  with Chevron Corporation (NYSE:). But crude oil prices wound up falling sharply, and the leverage used to fund the deal amplified the impact of those declines on OXY stock. Ã¢ÂÂ¢ That history, however, makes OXY somewhat interesting at the moment. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices actually have recovered most of their losses Ã¢ÂÂ but the same isnÃ¢ÂÂt true for the stock. ItÃ¢ÂÂs too simple to argue that OXY should return to $60+, but there is a case that shares should retrace more of the losses than they have so far. With a key level around $47 and the 200-day moving average not far above current levels, that case needs to be right. If it is, OXY can bust through resistance and continue its breakout.

      " Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are rising again on Wednesday, extending an extraordinary climb for the stock recently. Including the stock's intraday 6.4% gain as of 11:15 a.m. EST on Wednesday, shares are up more than 140% over the past four months. The stock's sharp gain on Wednesday follows yet another analyst's decision to increase his 12-month price target for the electric-car maker's stock ahead of earnings on Jan. 29. Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors on Wednesday that he believes the company's fourth-quarter earnings and its guidance for vehicle deliveries will not disappoint investors when Tesla reports results later this month. He believes there's robust demand for vehicles in China and Europe. Further, he is particularly bullish on the company's opportunity in China following the start of production at the company's Shanghai factory earlier this year. The opportunity for Tesla in the China market is worth $100 to $300 per share, Ives estimates. The analyst boosted his price target for the stock to $550 -- up from a $370 price target previously. The analyst has a neutral rating on the stock. In addition to reporting its financial results for its fourth quarter on Jan. 29, Tesla will also likely provide guidance for vehicle deliveries in 2020. The automaker saw deliveries rise 50% year over year in 2019, and investors are expecting more sharp growth this year.

      " Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett is one of the most-followed and successful investors on the planet. Even though the \"Oracle of Omaha\" only managed to keep pace with the return of the benchmark S&P 500 over the past decade, there's little denying how impressive his investing prowess has been over the long run. After all, he has created more than $400 billion in wealth for his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. One of the ways Buffett builds wealth for himself and his shareholders is by investing a significant amount of Berkshire's money. Right now, Berkshire owns 48 securities with a market value of $251 billion. Suffice it to say that when Buffett buys or sells a stock, Wall Street and investors pay close attention. In 2019, Buffett wound up opening a position in or adding to nine companies. But the Oracle of Omaha also sold shares in or completely sold out of nine stocks. Here are the companies Buffett lightened the load on last year. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett at his company's annual shareholder meeting. Image source: The Motley Fool. No, your eyes aren't deceiving you -- Berkshire Hathaway did sell 750,000 shares of tech kingpin Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the third quarter. Keep in mind, though, that Buffett and his team still hold 248.8 million shares and that at nearly $75 billion in value, Apple is Berkshire's largest position by a mile! It's unclear why 750,000 shares were disposed of, but it seems pretty clear that Buffett wasn't behind the sale. Remember that while Buffett is in control of the lion's share of Berkshire's investment portfolio, a small number of his trusted team are also free to make investments. Buffett has suggested he has no intention of paring his Apple stake, so this sale likely represents a move by a member of his team and not the Oracle himself. During the third quarter, we also saw Berkshire Hathaway reduce its holdings in satellite radio operator Sirius XM (NASDAQ: SIRI) by 1.64 million shares. This, too, was a very small paring of about 1%, with Berkshire continuing to hold 136.3 million shares, or 3.1% of Sirius XM's outstanding share count. Although Sirius XM's expenses rose considerably in 2019 following the closure of its acquisition of Pandora, Berkshire's modest sale doesn't appear to indicate any change in thinking from Buffett. Sirius XM remains the only game in town when it comes to satellite radio, and it should, in theory, crush its year-over-year comparisons as it realizes synergies from its Pandora acquisition and builds on its subscriber and streaming base. Image source: Wells Fargo. Maybe the biggest eye-opener of 2019 was that Buffett sold a portion of his stake in money center bank Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) in the first and third quarters (according to 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission). In total, Berkshire sold more than 48 million shares of its Wells Fargo stake last year and now holds close to 378.4 million shares. Why sell a position that's been held for more than 30 years? Although the case could be made that Buffett is a bit gun-shy with Wells Fargo following its fake-account scandal in 2016, the reasoning looks to be more tied with Buffett lowering his stake to a more comfortable level. Berkshire began the year owning close to 10% of Wells Fargo's outstanding shares, and Buffett has long preferred to keep his stakes below that key threshold. The selling was even more pronounced with integrated oil and gas giant Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX). Buffett shrank his company's stake in Phillips 66 by more than 6.7 million shares in 2019, representing a 56% haircut. The likeliest reason behind this reduction has to do with Buffett pledging $10 billion to Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) to help facilitate its acquisition of Anadarko. This investment appeared to signal Buffett's view that Occidental is a more attractive oil and gas play than Phillips 66, which has increased more than 200% since Buffett's initial stake in 2012. Energy is not a big portion of Berkshire's portfolio, so it wouldn't be surprising if Buffett were also simply locking in some gains. Image source: IBM. Berkshire Hathaway also completely disposed of its stake in cloud services company Red Hat, albeit this statement comes with an asterisk. That's because IBM (NYSE: IBM) acquired Red Hat in a $34 billion all-cash deal that closed in July. IBM has seen its sales fall precipitously for the better part of six years and is hoping that Red Hat's enterprise-focused suite of cloud products will help reignite top-line growth. Buffett, a previous (and disappointed) owner of IBM stock, was simply happy to take the cash from this deal and walk away. A somewhat regular fixture in Berkshire's sale column in recent years is cable services provider Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR). Berkshire sold shares on a couple of occasions in 2019, ultimately reducing its stake by 1.61 million shares to 5.43 million. Despite the consistent threat of cord-cutting, Charter's stock has been molten hot. Shares have tripled since Buffett took his initial stake in 2014, and the Oracle of Omaha's regular selling looks to be nothing more than modest profit taking to lock in gains. Considering that Charter's top line is growing by a mere 5% annually and the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio is an aggressive 37, I can't exactly blame Buffett for trimming his total. Despite Berkshire owning a stake in four airline stocks, only Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) found itself cruising at a lower altitude in Buffett's portfolio in 2019. However, similar to Apple and Sirius XM, the sale proved to be modest. Buffett reduced his company's stake in Southwest by roughly 1.2 million shares, or about 2%. Buffett became enamored with airlines in 2016, following West Texas Intermediate oil's brief collapse below $30 a barrel. With fuel representing a core expense for airlines, this drop in crude led to a windfall of profits. More specifically, it allowed major airlines to be more price competitive with the bare-bones-ticket airlines. But with the U.S. economy likely in the late innings of its economic expansion and the airline industry having a poor track record during recessions, it wouldn't be surprising to see Buffett further shrink his holdings in Southwest and his other airline stocks in 2020. Image source: Getty Images. Similar to Red Hat, Berkshire \"disposed\" of its longtime stake in building products manufacturer USG Corp. in the second quarter following German-based Knauf's acquisition of USG for $43.50 in cash per share plus a $0.50-per-share special dividend. This worked out to about $7 billion in total market value. The deal ultimately combined two building material giants to create a company with improved operating efficiency and global scale in the drywall business. Last but not least, Buffett sold his \"whopper of a stake\" (note: sarcasm is imminent) of telecom provider Verizon (NYSE: VZ) in the first quarter. That stake tallied 928 shares, with a market value of around $52,000. What's really odd is that Berkshire sold 99.99% of its Verizon stake in the fourth quarter of 2016 (a 15-million-share disposition) but left the remaining 928 shares in the portfolio for more than two additional years. Buffett stopped being a fan of telecoms a while ago, so why Verizon's token stake lasted this long remains a mystery. But perhaps the bigger mystery is, what stocks might Buffett sell in 2020?  10 stocks we like better than Wells FargoWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) jumped on Tuesday, rising 6.5% as of 11:10 a.m. EST. The gain follows one analyst's decision to significantly increase his 12-month price target for the stock based on the company's recent execution and his expectations for more sharp sales growth from the electric-car company in the coming years. Image source: The Motley Fool. New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu gave Tesla stock an $800 12-month price target on Tuesday. This is up from his previous 12-month price target of $530. Supporting the stock's 80% gain over the last year has been the company's \"technological dominance, strong sustained demand, Tesla's ability to execute,\" said Ferragu in a note to investors.  Looking ahead, Ferragu thinks Tesla's annual deliveries can increase from a run rate of about 450,000 today to 2 million to 3 million units by 2025. In addition, the analyst believes the company will boast \"industry leading margins.\" Tesla stock's wild gain recently means investors will be watching closely when the automaker reports fourth-quarter results on Jan. 29. Investors will be looking for another profitable quarter and guidance for more strong growth in deliveries in 2020.

      " Last year was another lackluster one for investors in the energy patch. The average energy stock in the S&P 500 rose only about 5% on the year, which vastly trailed the overall index's 28.9% surge. The energy sector's underperformance came even though the price of oil rebounded about 35% on the year.  That's left several of the sector's top companies trading at relatively attractive valuations, making them great buys right now. Leading the way are midstream giant Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET), top-tier upstream oil and gas producer EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), and leading refiner Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: MPC). Image source: Getty Images. Energy Transfer is one of the largest master limited partnerships in the energy sector. While big companies usually don't grow very quickly, that's not the case with Energy Transfer, as it was on track to expand its earnings by 16% last year. That trend should continue again this year. Because investors highly value growth, companies with strong growth rates tend to trade at premium valuations. However, for whatever reason, investors aren't giving Energy Transfer any credit for its above-average growth profile. Instead, they value the company at less than 9 times its earnings, which is well below its peer-group average of around 11. This low valuation, which has only gotten cheaper in the past year, is a big reason Energy Transfer currently yields an eye-popping 9%. That yield, when combined with Energy Transfer's low valuation and growth prospects, gives it the potential to generate significant total returns when investors finally come to their senses. EOG Resources' performance over the past year has been a real head-scratcher. Shares of the oil producer have tumbled about 16% even though crude prices have rebounded sharply. The reason that underperformance doesn't make sense is that EOG Resources can thrive at $50 oil. At that price point, the company can produce enough cash to grow its oil output by more than 10%, as well as fund its dividend with room to spare. That's why it's producing a gusher of excess cash now that crude prices are around $60 a barrel. EOG Resources believes its strategy of drilling low-cost, high-return oil wells that grow both its production and excess cash should make it a winner over the long term. Marathon Petroleum also delivered an underwhelming performance last year, as shares slumped 14%. That's leading an activist investor to press the company to make some changes to unlock shareholder value. It's already working on some of them, which includes plans to spin off its Speedway gas station business as a separate publicly traded company later this year. Meanwhile, it's also evaluating options for MPLX, its MLP, which could include spinning off the units it owns to create an independent company. Those moves to refocus its strategy on its core refining business should enable Marathon to take even greater advantage of new fuel standards in the shipping sector. That catalyst, when combined with other actions it's taking to increase its refining margin, should help bolster that business. Add that to the potential value-unlocking moves from spinning off affiliated entities, and analysts expect Marathon's stock to be a big winner this year. Energy stocks continued to disappoint investors last year, even though oil prices rebounded. That's due in large part to investor sentiment that remains negative despite improving industry fundamentals. Although it will likely take quite some time for investors to change their minds, when they do, this trio could produce significant gains, given their underperformance last year despite all they have going for them. That makes them among the most compelling energy stocks to buy right now. 10 stocks we like better than Marathon PetroleumWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has proven to be one of the keys to unlocking a treasure trove of oil and gas trapped in tight rock formations. It has almost single-handedly turned the U.S. into an energy export juggernaut. While fracking has fueled significant production growth in the country, it hasn't helped boost the stock prices of most energy companies. That's because most focused on growing no matter the cost instead of aiming to create value for their shareholders. That approach, however, has started to change in recent years, as many fracking-focused producers are using the process to generate free cash instead of even more production. That potentially sets these companies up to produce strong returns in the coming year. Three that stand out this January are EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG). Image source: Getty Images. EOG Resources is one of the country's fracking leaders. While the company -- like many of its peers -- initially focused on growing its output as fast as it could, it has shifted its aim toward earning premium returns on the wells it drills. As a result, EOG Resources has become one of the lowest-cost producers in the country.  It currently only needs oil to average around $50 a barrel to provide it with enough cash flow to grow its production at a double-digit rate while also supporting its fast-growing dividend. Since crude oil is currently in the $60s, it's on track to produce significant free cash flow in the coming year. EOG plans to use that money to pay off debt as it comes due, allowing it to strengthen its already top-notch balance sheet. The company believes that its strategy will enable it to produce market-smashing returns over the long haul, making it a top fracking stock to buy this month. Devon Energy has spent the past few years transitioning into a low-cost, U.S-focused oil growth company. It completed its transformation last month by selling its remaining low-margin gas assets. Now it's on track to start generating lots of excess cash this year. In Devon's estimation, it can fund its current drilling program and dividend as long as oil averages $48 a barrel this year. As such, it's on course to produce about $675 million in free cash this year if oil stays around its current $60-a-barrel level. Devon plans on using all that money to continue buying back stock, which could catapult its shares higher this year. Diamondback Energy has significantly grown its scale over the years by acquiring drillable land in the oil-rich Permian Basin. That has enabled it to drive down costs and improve profitability. This strategy should start paying some real dividends in 2020. In Diamondback's estimation, it can produce enough cash at $45-a-barrel oil to fund its growth-focused drilling program and its dividend. Because of that, it's on track to generate a significant amount of free cash flow in 2020. At $55 a barrel, for example, it can match Devon's level of producing $675 million in free cash flow this year, all of which it intends on returning to shareholders via its stock buyback program. With crude currently well above that level, Diamondback is on pace to produce even more cash this year, which it will likely return to investors. That's why most analysts believe its stock has the biggest upside ahead in 2020. These three fracking stocks have all worked hard to enable their operations to thrive at lower oil prices. As a result, they're on course to produce a significant amount of free cash flow in the coming years since crude is currently well above their breakeven levels. That sets these companies up to return a gusher of cash to their investors this year via dividends and share buybacks, which could help them produce market-beating total returns. This upside potential makes them the top fracking stocks to buy this month. 10 stocks we like better than Devon EnergyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Oil companies have a spotty history as dividend stocks. The sector was once an excellent place for income-seeking investors to get above-average yields. However, when oil prices fell off their triple-digit perch a few years ago, it took many of the sector's dividends down with it. The industry has worked hard since that time to deal with its new reality of lower oil prices by cutting costs. These efforts have been paying dividends. That has allowed producers to begin sending more cash to their investors once again. And that means income-focused investors should start paying closer attention to this sector. Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy (NYSE: WPX) has been working hard over the past few years to reshape its business. The company sold several assets to reduce debt as well as finance its expansion program in the low-cost, oil-rich Permian Basin. Those moves were all part of a strategy to begin returning cash to its investors by 2021.  Last year was a pivotal one for the oil and gas company as it reached its debt reduction target. The company entered 2019 needing oil to average only about $50 a barrel to fund its expansion plan. However, thanks to higher oil prices, additional asset sales, excellent operating results, and a needle-moving acquisition, WPX Energy was able to accelerate its capital return program. It started by authorizing a $400 million share repurchase program in August. It has since initiated a quarterly dividend, which it will begin paying after closing its latest acquisition. While that payout's implied yield of 0.8% might not be all the appealing to income-seeking investors, WPX Energy should have the fuel to grow its dividend at a healthy rate in the coming years, which makes it more attractive.  Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy is joining many of its peers in starting small. However, what these payouts have lacked in size, they've more than made up for with growth. Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), for example, initiated a small dividend last year, which yielded around 0.5%. The company boosted that payout by 50% earlier this year and now yields about 0.9%. With Diamondback on track to generate a gusher of free cash in 2020 if oil remains at its current level, it will probably give its investors another sizable raise next year as well as buy back a big chunk of its stock.  Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD), meanwhile, had been paying its investors a paltry dividend for many years. However, the company started increasing it at a rapid pace in 2018. This year alone, Pioneer doubled its payout in February and then boosted it by another 175% in August. As a result, it has now increased its dividend by an eye-popping 2,100% in the last two years, driving its yield up to 1.2%. Oil giants ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), likewise, have boosted their payouts at impressive rates. ConocoPhillips was one of several oil stocks that slashed its dividend as a result of crashing crude prices a few years ago. However, it has been growing at an accelerated rate in recent years. The company started with a 6% increase in 2016 and followed that up with two more last year -- 7.5% in February and another 7% in December -- before giving its investors a monster 38% raise this October. With that latest increase, ConocoPhillips now yields an above-average 2.7%. EOG Recourses, on the other hand, kept its payout flat during the darkest days of the oil market downturn. It has since restarted its dividend growth engine, giving its investors two raises last year and another 31% increase this year. As a result, it now yields about 1.5%. More high-octane growth, however, is up ahead, given that the company aims to push its yield up to at least the level of the S&P 500, which is around 2%. While most oil stocks don't pay high yields these days, many are growing their payouts at rapid rates. That's noteworthy, considering that dividend growth stocks have historically produced the highest total returns. That's why income investors might want to consider adding a dividend-paying oil stock to their portfolio since they could generate some high-octane total returns in the coming years as they keep increasing their payouts at a fast pace.  10 stocks we like better than ConocoPhillipsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " The energy sector has been the worst-performing one in the S&P 500 for several years running. It's not even close. The S&P 500 has rallied 75% over the past five years, while energy stocks, as measured by the Energy Select SPDR ETF, have produced a negative 5% return. On a more positive note, the sector has bounced back a bit this year, rising 7% year to date. Still, that has badly trailed the scorching-hot S&P 500, which is up nearly 30% on the year.  Wall Street analysts, however, expect better things from energy stocks in 2020. Not only are they bullish on the sector overall, but they also see some potentially big winners. Here's a look at the five oil stocks that they believe have the most upside in 2020. Image source: Getty Images. Most analysts are bullish on Permian Basin-focused oil driller Concho Resources (NYSE: CXO). Overall, 79% of those who follow the company have a buy or equivalent rating on its stock, with their consensus 12-month price target coming in at $100.74. With shares recently trading at around $78.75 apiece, analysts see 28% upside. One reason analysts like what's ahead for Concho Resources is that it recently launched a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. With its stock tumbling more than 20% this year due to the poor results of a well spacing test in the second quarter, its buyback could retire about 10% of its outstanding shares. That repurchase program could provide a meaningful lift to Concho's stock in the coming year. Eighty-three percent of the analysts who cover shale giant EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) have a buy or equivalent rating. Even after adding in their less bullish peers, the 12-month consensus price target for the stock is $99.03 per share, which is about 31% above its recent price. What analysts love most about EOG is that it continues to exceed expectations. That was the case during the third quarter, as its oil production beat its guidance while costs came in below projections. That trend should continue in 2020, which is why analysts believe EOG's shares have lots of room to run.  Refining giant Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: MPC) is a favorite among the analyst community. Currently, 89% of those who follow the stock have a buy or equivalent rating, with a 12-month consensus price target of $80.65. That implies 38% upside given that shares recently traded at $58.61 apiece. The main factor driving that optimism is that activist investor Elliott Management is pushing the company to make changes to boost shareholder value. One of those is to spin off its Speedway gas station business into a separate publicly traded company, which Marathon expects to complete by the end of next year. That move to unlock value, as well as others the company intends on making to boost its profitability, could propel its stock higher in 2020. Image source: Getty Images. While not as many analysts are bullish on TechnipFMC (NYSE: FTI) -- roughly 81% rate its stock a buy or equivalent -- those that are believe its shares could soar. That's clear from the 12-month consensus price target of $28.56, which is 43% above its recent trading price. The top reason analysts see so much upside is that TechnipFMC plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2020. One will focus on providing engineering and construction services to the energy sector, while the other will be a fully integrated technology and services provider. That move has the potential to unlock value for investors as those companies focus on their core areas of expertise.  Analysts adore Permian Basin driller Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG). An eye-popping 97% of those who follow the company rate its stock a buy or something equivalent. Furthermore, their 12-month consensus price target is $124 per share, which is a whopping 46% above its recent price. One thing analysts love about Diamondback is that it's on track to generate a gusher of free cash flow next year. If crude averages $55 a barrel in 2020, the company will produce $675 million in free cash flow. It will haul in even more cash if oil stays near its current price of around $60 a barrel. Diamondback will likely return all that cash to investors via its rapidly rising dividend and share repurchase program. As a result, analysts believe it can generate high-octane returns in 2020.  While the energy sector has underperformed in recent years, analysts see some bright spots that could deliver big gains for investors in the coming year. They see the most upside in these five oil stocks, due in part because most have a noteworthy catalyst that could boost their share prices in 2020. Investors should at least take a closer look at this group, as they could deliver big-time returns over the next 12 months.  10 stocks we like better than Marathon PetroleumWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n",

      " EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) is an oil exploration and production company based out of Houston, Texas. It competes with other E&P companies including ConocoPhillips, Chesapeake Energy and Occidental Petroleum. EOG has one of the lowest break-even barrel cost of oil among its peers, which has led to its current out-performance and allowed the company to come through the recent low-price environment. With oil prices rising again, EOG will in all likelihood increase crude output – helping it improve both its revenue and margins. Trefis highlights trends in EOG’s Revenues over the years along with our forecast for 2019 and 2020 in an interactive dashboard, parts of which are highlighted below.   An Overview of EOG’s Revenues EOG Resources has 3 operating segments that generated $11.9 billion in revenues in 2018. \n",

      " Everyone knows that Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) makes trucks, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) makes electric vehicles. But Rivian Automotive? What the heck is that? By the time 2020 is out, I suspect absolutely no one will be asking this question. If you haven't heard of Rivian Automotive yet, here's a quick rundown. Image source: Rivian Automotive. Based in Plymouth, Michigan, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence Rivian Automotive set up shop back in 2009 (although we didn't start hearing a lot about it until just last year). The company hasn't begun operations yet, really, but plans to begin selling its first two electric trucks, the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, in late 2020. Kelley Blue Book advises that both models will seat at least five passengers, with the R1S having an optional three-row, seven-passenger configuration. As all-electric vehicles, they will not have a gas engine -- but may not need one to allay consumers' range anxiety, because both vehicles will be rated for between 300 and 410 miles fully charged.   Because they're trucks, they'll boast significant towing capacity -- 11,000 pounds for the R1T and 7,700 pounds for the R1S. And because they're electric, they'll be able to go really fast when not towing a boat or camper -- accelerating from 0 to 60 in as little as three seconds. Neither truck will be cheap. Rivian expects to price the R1T at $69,000 to start, and the R1S at $72,500, both prices before state and federal tax credits. Now admittedly, none of this information will make much difference to consumers (or investors) if Rivian goes bust, or fails to produce the products it's promised. But recent financing rounds suggest that Rivian will in fact have the cash it needs to go the distance. Last year, for example, Rivian attracted a $700 million investment from a consortium led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which later awarded Rivian a contract to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans specially designed for Amazon's use. (Deliveries will begin in 2020 or 2021, and continue through 2024).   In swift succession, Rivian won a further $500 million investment from a company you'd think would consider it a rival -- Ford -- and $350 million from privately held Cox Automotive. Those investments alone probably would have been enough to make Rivian a viable contender to Tesla, which has an SUV of its own on the market already (Model X), and announced an electric pickup truck offering in November (Cybertruck). But in the waning days of December, Rivian won an even bigger investment -- more money than Ford and Amazon ponied up, combined. On Monday, December 23, Rivian announced it had secured a $1.3 billion investment from \"funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.\" With that money in hand, Rivian ended the year with nearly $3 billion in new funding. Given that the company already has a production plant to build in (Mitsubishi's old plant in Normal, Illinois), $3 billion should be just enough cash to develop the three closely related truck/van models revealed so far. According to autoblog.com, the average cost to develop new cars is about $1 billion per model.   Of course, the question still remains: Will Rivian's trucks sell? According to Wall Street Journal auto reporter Dan Neil, \"we are living through the S-curve of EV adoption,\" and 2020 could very well become the year of the electric \"car.\" That being said, there are going to be a lot of electric cars coming to market this year to choose from, with more than a dozen new models coming on line to compete with existing fare such as Tesla's Models S, 3, and X and Nissan's Leaf.   Although it's hard to keep track of all the moving parts, WSJ alone highlights Volvo's XC40 Recharge, Ford's Mustang Mach-E, and Mini's Mini Cooper SE as viable contenders in addition to Tesla's and Nissan's wares. At starting prices ranging from $60,500 (Ford) to just $30,750 (Mini), each of these new rivals underprices Rivian's offering.   One thing Rivian has got, however, that everyone else has not: Last week, Rivian released a video demonstrating its new \"tank turn\" feature that will be available for both the R1T and R1S. Like a modern main battle tank, the truck's four electric motors can spin in different directions, enabling the truck to literally turn on a dime -- spinning itself around a fixed point.   Probably thought up as a way to market the truck to off-roaders initially, this feature would also make Rivian's truck incredibly maneuverable in tight spaces, such as might be encountered on construction sites, in crowded driveways, and parking garages -- the latter perhaps a valuable selling point to suburban shoppers. Combined with the right software, I suspect Rivian's tank-turn feature will also make parallel parking in even the tightest spaces a breeze. Long story short, yes, this truck will sell. Now, all Rivian needs to do is build it.  10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Investing in a group of quality growth stocks and sticking with them for decades can lead to life-changing wealth. An investment of just $100 per month at an annualized return of 12% over 50 years can grow to $3.9 million.  Three stocks that can help you achieve those returns are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here's why these stocks should remain compounding machines for the next 50 years. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's Google is still benefiting from the shift of ad spending moving online. Its range of products and platforms, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, and Gmail, each have over one billion users. That's attractive to advertisers, and it's why Google is the No. 3 most valuable brand in the world, according to Brand Finance.  However, over the next 50 years, Alphabet will likely generate significant amounts of revenue from other businesses. The one analysts are watching heading into 2020 is Google Cloud. Google's \"other revenue\" that includes Google Cloud, Google Play, Google Home, and other hardware products has been Alphabet's fastest-growing segment in the last few years, and it may reach 20% of the company's total revenue in 2020.  There are not many companies as forward-thinking as Alphabet that have the resources to invest billions in new growth avenues. The company considers its investments in moonshot opportunities, or \"other bets,\" as vital to its future success. These other bets include potential world-changers, such as self-driving cars with Waymo, or growth opportunities in life sciences with Verily.  Don't let Alphabet's $992 billion market cap make you think the stock has already run its course. The company has more than doubled its revenue and earnings over the last five years, and given its forward-thinking corporate culture, Alphabet should continue to grow for many years. Moving one spot below Google on Brand Finance's most valuable brand list is Microsoft, at No. 4. The software giant has been making essential tools for people to get stuff done for decades. Microsoft has over 900 million Windows 10 users. Under CEO Sadya Nadella, the company has spread its reach well beyond the PC to mobile devices and the cloud. Microsoft has the brand recognition, network effect advantage, and resources to continue winning in the markets it serves. Its Office software is still in high demand after all these years. Even though Apple has 1.4 billion users of its devices, the familiarity people have with Apple's software hasn't dethroned Microsoft's Word and Excel. Office commercial products, including 365 subscriptions, have been growing fast, up 25% year over year in the most recent quarter.  Also, businesses are continuing to use cloud-based tools to handle IT services. The infrastructure-as-a-service cloud market is expected to grow three times faster than traditional IT services through 2022, according to Gartner. Microsoft Azure has tremendous momentum in this space, with revenue surging 59% year over year in the last quarter.  Microsoft has proven it can adapt its basic software services to the cloud and develop new cloud-based platforms for businesses, such as Dynamics 365 and Azure. The ability to adapt to changing environments in technology gives me confidence that the company will still be around in 50 years. It offers good growth prospects, high margins, and a growing stream of dividends. Owning the stock seems like a no-brainer for the 21st century. Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Tesla is not short of investor attention. The stock has experienced a meteoric rise since its initial public offering in 2010, but the sky truly is the limit for Elon Musk's company. Some on Wall Street are debating whether it's time to sell the stock after the share price more than doubled off of its lows last year. But I think long-term investors should stay the course, and if you don't already own shares, you should consider starting a small position. Tesla is at the center of a secular trend sweeping the world, as alternative forms of energy are increasingly in demand for everything from how homes are built to what fuels our cars. Tesla is known for its Model S, Model X, and Model 3 electric vehicles, but it defines its mission as helping the world accelerate to sustainable energy through various energy products, including solar electricity. The company has installed thousands of solar products for consumers since 2006, and last year, it released Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.  You can't underestimate a visionary leader like Musk, who has demonstrated a great talent for seeing an opportunity and starting a business to capture it. As Tesla approaches a $100 billion market cap, the company still has a tiny share of the nearly 100 million vehicles shipped in the industry every year. There were about 367,500 Tesla vehicles delivered in 2019, for an increase of 50% year over year. That growth is thanks to the Model 3, which went into production in 2017 and comes at a much more affordable price for the masses.  However, Musk believes the upcoming Model Y will outsell the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined. As Tesla releases more models, builds Gigafactories around the world, increases scale, and brings prices down for these cars, it's inevitable the company will hit the one-million delivery mark at some point. There is enormous upside for the Tesla brand over the next 50 years. All three stocks are already large caps, but each could keep heading higher from here. Consider that Coca-Cola started in 1886, but the stock is still increasing in value for shareholders. Walt Disney was started in 1923, but the stock is up 355% over the last 10 years. Great growth stocks continue to find ways to deliver returns for shareholders, and I believe Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla will be no different.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " You might not usually think of the U.S. energy industry and the USMCA -- the proposed U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade deal that's been called \"new NAFTA\" and \"NAFTA 2.0\" -- at the same time. Trade matters, though, to oil and gas producers. The U.S. is not only the world's leading producer of oil and gas, but it also became a net exporter of petroleum for the first time in September. It's now essentially tied with Saudi Arabia as the biggest oil exporter in the world.  A lot of that oil and gas heads to Canada and Mexico. Fully 29.2% of exported petroleum and 75% of exported natural gas heads to one of our two neighbors. That makes the Canadian and Mexican markets vitally important for the five biggest U.S. oil producers  ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) and numerous smaller producers, too. Here's how the USMCA deal is likely to affect them. The oil and gas industry didn't feature prominently in USMCA coverage, but exports are a top concern for U.S. producers. Image source: Getty Images. The initial version of the USMCA was ratified in September 2018. However, negotiations between the White House and Congress have prompted some changes. Trouble is, a final version hasn't been released yet, so we have to rely on the September 2018 version, along with comments (or the lack thereof) made by various politicians about what was changed and what stayed the same. What stayed the same was...just about everything, apparently. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley notoriously said in 2018 that \"95% of [the USMCA] is the same as NAFTA.\" With the recent changes, that may have -- maybe -- dropped to 90% or even 85%, but the bulk of the agreement is the same. In particular, for ExxonMobil and its top oil-producing peers, that includes the 0% preferential tariff rate on oil and gas exports, as well as automatic export approval. This isn't unexpected, but it's a huge win for the industry, as tariffs would likely have jeopardized the U.S.'s newfound status as a leading energy exporter.  One major change that appears to have been made to the final version of the USMCA involves the controversial \"Chapter 11.\" No, not bankruptcy: NAFTA Chapter 11 dealt with disputes between a company located in one NAFTA country and the government of another NAFTA country. It provided for a way to resolve those disputes without going through the court system of the government in question. The reason Chapter 11 came into existence was out of fear that a new government in one country could come into power and rewrite regulations or laws that would suddenly prohibit projects into which companies or investors in another country had already sunk a lot of money. Well, Chapter 11 is now mostly gone, except for a handful of industries...one of which is oil and gas. That's right: U.S. oil and gas companies -- which had just been granted admittance to Mexico in 2013 for the first time since 1938 -- were worried that a potential new government in Mexico might try to renationalize the industry and boot them from the country again. So they lobbied hard to keep their Chapter 11 rights in the USMCA, and it looks like they prevailed.  The last changes of any significance for Chevron and the other top U.S. producers are some tricky little regulations surrounding determining country of origin of oil and gas and their derivatives.  Without getting too bogged down in the details, basically NAFTA put the burden on a product exporter to prove that the country of origin of its product was a NAFTA country, and provided limited ways to do so. USMCA instead puts the onus on the importer, and provides multiple new ways to go about making the determination. In particular, hydrocarbons transported by pipeline can now be qualified in most cases, which wasn't true before. Because U.S. companies are more often exporters of oil than importers, the change is a net benefit for them. While some industries, including the automotive industry, saw substantial changes between NAFTA and USMCA, and between the 2018 USMCA and the newest version, not a lot seems to have changed for the oil and gas industry. But the alterations that have happened look like unqualified wins for ConocoPhillips, EOG, Occidental Petroleum, Exxon, Chevron, and even the smaller U.S. oil producers.  However, it's important to realize that the final version hasn't yet been ratified, and until that happens, there's always the chance something could go awry for the industry. For now, though, it looks like a Christmas present for U.S. oil and gas from our neighbors.  10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobilWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "  U.S. stocks seem to have lost their direction. After major indices reached all-time highs the day before Thanksgiving, the last seven sessions have seen uneven and modestly negative trading. That includes declines on Monday with stocks closing at session lows.   For skeptics who believe markets have run too far, recent trading might suggest that markets have peaked. For those still bullish on U.S. stocks, the modest pullback looks like a breather ahead of more gains. Tuesday’s big stock charts highlight names that might be of interest to the latter group. All three charts highlight stocks that seem to have the potential for a reversal. The potential seems even higher if investors are willing to take on more risk, which could boost two of those stocks — and perhaps lead the market to look beyond the third for returns.    Ahead of Monday’s 14% gain, there was some evidence that Canopy Growth (NYSE:) had the potential to break out. After the jump, the first of Tuesday’s big stock charts gives some hope that the breakout can continue:    Energy is another sector that has struggled over the past six months, and EOG Resources (NYSE:) hasn’t been immune to the sell-off. But, like CGC, EOG is showing signs of life, and the second of our big stock charts suggests a recent rally could continue:    The third of Tuesday’s big stock charts, Medtronic (NYSE:), also signals a potential reversal — but in the wrong direction: As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

      "  Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:) stock has become intriguing again. Investors sold CHK off when management raised “going concern” issues. However, recent debt financing deals have bought it more time.   Such a deal may make a recovery in CHK stock possible. However, recent successes in the oil patch have supplied the market with too much oil and gas. Given this reduced pricing, I would not recommend a speculative play in Chesapeake Energy stock. In the last earnings report, the company called into question its future as “going concern.” At that point, I sold my own speculative position, and it has fallen since that time. The problem for CHK stock is that the oil and gas boom has become a victim of its own success. The United States now produces so much oil and gas that these assets continue to lose value. Chevron (NYSE:) just announced that they would take between $10 billion and $11 billion in write-downs in the fourth quarter as a result. One has to assume that ExxonMobil (NYSE:), EOG Resources (NYSE:), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:), and other oil majors could follow suit. The company holds $9.34 billion in long-term debt, a crushing burden for a company with only a $1.5 billion market cap. Falling oil and gas prices and asset write-downs have dimmed the prospects of reducing that debt. Moreover, the move to buy Wildhorse Resources to sell more oil may have backfired as oil prices have also failed to gain traction. That said, the company has again made CHK stock alluring with the latest . One deal comes in the form of a $1.5 billion, 4.5-year loan facility that retired an existing revolving credit facility worth about $900 million. Under a separate debt agreement, it will issue . These will come due in 2025 and carry an 11.5% coupon. They will also finance the retirement of some debts at 62 cents and 70 cents on the dollar. While this appears strange, some of the bonds traded below 50 cents on the dollar, as . Hence, these bondholders still benefit. Moreover, these deals buy Chesapeake more time to clean up its balance sheet. All of this has helped take the CHK stock price back up to around 75 cents per share. Some stock market detractors refer to investing in equities as “gambling.” In most cases, I object to that view. However, that viewpoint may describe CHK stock accurately. I say this because  describes Chesapeake’s situation accurately. Not only must they execute a fourth-and-long play flawlessly, factors which the company does not control must also go right. To be sure, a lot could go wrong for Chesapeake Energy stock. The previously-mentioned asset write-downs do not bode well for the industry. Moreover, the U.S.-China trade dispute makes prospects for selling in China tenuous. The falling cost of renewables could also further dampen the demand for fossil fuels. That push for renewables could accelerate further if a Democrat wins the White House in 2020. Investors who feel they can prevail amid the above conditions may choose to buy. A 100% loss of one’s investment is a real possibility. However, if Chesapeake’s management has run the right play, and some factors that they do not control go right, the returns on CHK stock could run several multiples above 100%. Still, with the risks involved, this is not a move that I encourage. CHK stock has become a gamble with increasingly longer odds. Falling energy prices and statements from management have cast doubts about the future of Chesapeake. The company inspired some optimism with new debt financing deals. However, conditions continue to worsen as energy prices fail to gain traction. Moreover, geopolitical uncertainties and the increased viability of so-called “clean” energy solutions could add to the revenue pressure. If the company manages to clean up its balance sheet, CHK stock will rise exponentially. However, failure could lead to bankruptcy, and external market conditions continue to bode poorly for the company. Given the worsening market environment, I would not recommend a speculative position here. As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

      " The price of crude oil has bounced around quite a bit this year. The U.S. oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, is currently right around $58 per barrel. While that's well below its high of more than $65 a barrel, it's still up more than 27% for the year. Despite the overall improvement in the price of oil, most energy stocks have lost value this year, given that the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF is down about 20% year to date. That slump in oil stocks doesn't make much sense, especially when several producers can thrive at the current oil price. Three that are doing just that are ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG). And they're all great oil stocks to buy right now. Image source: Getty Images. ConocoPhillips has been putting up excellent numbers all year. Through the third quarter, the U.S. oil giant has produced $4 billion of free cash flow, with oil prices in the U.S. that have averaged about $57 per barrel this year. The company has returned nearly all that money to investors through its dividend and share repurchase plan. However, despite that strong financial performance, its shares have fallen by about 3% this year.  Because of that underperformance, ConocoPhillips' stock looks like an excellent buy, given what it sees ahead. The company recently unveiled its 10-year plan, which would see it generate a jaw-dropping $50 billion free cash flow, assuming oil averages $50 a barrel. That will give it the money to continue paying a growing dividend as well as buy back another $30 billion in stock. For perspective, that's enough money to retire nearly half its outstanding shares at the current price. The company's ability to generate a gusher of free cash flow at lower oil prices should enable it to produce strong total returns in the coming years. Earlier this year, Devon Energy laid out a bold transformation plan to focus all its attention on its four oil-rich U.S. shale assets. That strategy is clearly delivering results. One of the highlights is that the company is on track to generate more than $3 billion in excess cash this year thanks to a combination of free cash flow and asset sales. It has used those funds to pay off debt and repurchase stock. As a result, it now has one of the lowest leverage ratios in the oil patch. It's also on track to reduce its outstanding share count by 30% from its peak level in 2017. Despite all that success, its stock is only up about 1% on the year.  Devon's new strategy has it well positioned to prosper in the coming years. In 2020, it can generate enough cash at $48 oil to pay its dividend as well as drill the new wells needed to grow its oil production by 7% to 9%. Because of that low oil price breakeven level, the company can generate a gusher of free cash flow at higher prices. For example, if crude averages around $55 a barrel next year, Devon could produce $400 million in free cash. That's enough to repurchase another 4.5% of its outstanding stock at the current price. Image source: Getty Images. EOG Resources has also delivered excellent operational and financial results this year. During the third quarter, for example, its oil production was up 12% year over year, coming in above the high end of its target range. Meanwhile, the company produced $2 billion in cash. That was enough money to cover its rapidly growing dividend as well as its capital expenses with more than $300 million to spare, bringing its year-to-date free cash flow total to $774 million.  CEO Bill Thomas commented on the company's performance: EOG's operating performance has never been better. The company generated outstanding financial results in the third quarter driven by improvements in every area. We reduced operating expenses, grew volumes at double‐digit rates while lowering well costs and generated substantial free cash flow. EOG has never been in a better position to sustain this success long into the future.  That's evident by its initial outlook for 2020. The company expects to deliver similar results next year, with it aiming to grow its oil output by a double-digit rate while producing free cash as long as oil is above $50 a barrel. That will give it the funds to grow its dividend while also continuing to strengthen what's already one of the top balance sheets in the sector. Meanwhile, with shares of the oil company declining by about 15% this year despite its strong performance, investors can buy this top-notch oil stock for an excellent price. ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, and EOG Resources are in an elite group of oil stocks. All have top-tier balance sheets and ultra-low costs, which enables them to generate a gusher of free cash flow at low oil prices. They all have the potential to produce some big-time total returns once the market realizes how well they can perform at current oil prices. That makes them excellent oil stocks to buy right now with the long term in mind.  10 stocks we like better than Devon EnergyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are rising again on Wednesday, extending an extraordinary climb for the stock recently. Including the stock's intraday 6.4% gain as of 11:15 a.m. EST on Wednesday, shares are up more than 140% over the past four months. The stock's sharp gain on Wednesday follows yet another analyst's decision to increase his 12-month price target for the electric-car maker's stock ahead of earnings on Jan. 29. Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors on Wednesday that he believes the company's fourth-quarter earnings and its guidance for vehicle deliveries will not disappoint investors when Tesla reports results later this month. He believes there's robust demand for vehicles in China and Europe. Further, he is particularly bullish on the company's opportunity in China following the start of production at the company's Shanghai factory earlier this year. The opportunity for Tesla in the China market is worth $100 to $300 per share, Ives estimates. The analyst boosted his price target for the stock to $550 -- up from a $370 price target previously. The analyst has a neutral rating on the stock. In addition to reporting its financial results for its fourth quarter on Jan. 29, Tesla will also likely provide guidance for vehicle deliveries in 2020. The automaker saw deliveries rise 50% year over year in 2019, and investors are expecting more sharp growth this year.

      " Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) jumped on Tuesday, rising 6.5% as of 11:10 a.m. EST. The gain follows one analyst's decision to significantly increase his 12-month price target for the stock based on the company's recent execution and his expectations for more sharp sales growth from the electric-car company in the coming years. Image source: The Motley Fool. New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu gave Tesla stock an $800 12-month price target on Tuesday. This is up from his previous 12-month price target of $530. Supporting the stock's 80% gain over the last year has been the company's \"technological dominance, strong sustained demand, Tesla's ability to execute,\" said Ferragu in a note to investors.  Looking ahead, Ferragu thinks Tesla's annual deliveries can increase from a run rate of about 450,000 today to 2 million to 3 million units by 2025. In addition, the analyst believes the company will boast \"industry leading margins.\" Tesla stock's wild gain recently means investors will be watching closely when the automaker reports fourth-quarter results on Jan. 29. Investors will be looking for another profitable quarter and guidance for more strong growth in deliveries in 2020.

      " Oil companies have a spotty history as dividend stocks. The sector was once an excellent place for income-seeking investors to get above-average yields. However, when oil prices fell off their triple-digit perch a few years ago, it took many of the sector's dividends down with it. The industry has worked hard since that time to deal with its new reality of lower oil prices by cutting costs. These efforts have been paying dividends. That has allowed producers to begin sending more cash to their investors once again. And that means income-focused investors should start paying closer attention to this sector. Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy (NYSE: WPX) has been working hard over the past few years to reshape its business. The company sold several assets to reduce debt as well as finance its expansion program in the low-cost, oil-rich Permian Basin. Those moves were all part of a strategy to begin returning cash to its investors by 2021.  Last year was a pivotal one for the oil and gas company as it reached its debt reduction target. The company entered 2019 needing oil to average only about $50 a barrel to fund its expansion plan. However, thanks to higher oil prices, additional asset sales, excellent operating results, and a needle-moving acquisition, WPX Energy was able to accelerate its capital return program. It started by authorizing a $400 million share repurchase program in August. It has since initiated a quarterly dividend, which it will begin paying after closing its latest acquisition. While that payout's implied yield of 0.8% might not be all the appealing to income-seeking investors, WPX Energy should have the fuel to grow its dividend at a healthy rate in the coming years, which makes it more attractive.  Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy is joining many of its peers in starting small. However, what these payouts have lacked in size, they've more than made up for with growth. Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), for example, initiated a small dividend last year, which yielded around 0.5%. The company boosted that payout by 50% earlier this year and now yields about 0.9%. With Diamondback on track to generate a gusher of free cash in 2020 if oil remains at its current level, it will probably give its investors another sizable raise next year as well as buy back a big chunk of its stock.  Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD), meanwhile, had been paying its investors a paltry dividend for many years. However, the company started increasing it at a rapid pace in 2018. This year alone, Pioneer doubled its payout in February and then boosted it by another 175% in August. As a result, it has now increased its dividend by an eye-popping 2,100% in the last two years, driving its yield up to 1.2%. Oil giants ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), likewise, have boosted their payouts at impressive rates. ConocoPhillips was one of several oil stocks that slashed its dividend as a result of crashing crude prices a few years ago. However, it has been growing at an accelerated rate in recent years. The company started with a 6% increase in 2016 and followed that up with two more last year -- 7.5% in February and another 7% in December -- before giving its investors a monster 38% raise this October. With that latest increase, ConocoPhillips now yields an above-average 2.7%. EOG Recourses, on the other hand, kept its payout flat during the darkest days of the oil market downturn. It has since restarted its dividend growth engine, giving its investors two raises last year and another 31% increase this year. As a result, it now yields about 1.5%. More high-octane growth, however, is up ahead, given that the company aims to push its yield up to at least the level of the S&P 500, which is around 2%. While most oil stocks don't pay high yields these days, many are growing their payouts at rapid rates. That's noteworthy, considering that dividend growth stocks have historically produced the highest total returns. That's why income investors might want to consider adding a dividend-paying oil stock to their portfolio since they could generate some high-octane total returns in the coming years as they keep increasing their payouts at a fast pace.  10 stocks we like better than ConocoPhillipsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is the second-largest publicly traded oil and gas company behind the recent IPO of the Saudi Arabian Oil Company. After a rough last five years of revamping its portfolio in an effort to adjust to the new reality of $50 to $70 oil, will Exxon be able to turn it around or will the next five years bring similar results?  XOM data by YCharts On paper, Exxon's stock looks pretty attractive. A price-to-earnings ratio of 20 and a 5 percent dividend yield place Exxon among both value stocks and dividend stocks, but the company is in growth mode, too. Image Source: Getty Images. In March, ExxonMobil announced its plans to \"accelerate Permian output to 1 million barrels per day by 2024.\" The Permian Basin is the nation's hottest shale play, producing nearly 5 million barrels per day, which is more than a third of total U.S. output and nearly half of U.S. onshore production. Exxon's announcement included the following takeaways: Exxon's quest comes at a steep cost. The energy stock was able to have such a massive increase in 2018 Permian production thanks to a $6.6 billion purchase of acreage in 2017. Since then, Exxon has continued to expand its Permian operations, and according to Argus Media, which tracks global energy business, \"unconventional output rose by 72% from a year earlier to 293,000 BOE/D [barrels of oil equivalent per day] in the third quarter of 2019.\" Meanwhile, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is on track to raise its Permian output to 900,000 BOE/D by 2023.  Aside from its Permian focus, ExxonMobil's 45% stake in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana is another multi-billion dollar investment. ExxonMobil expects the Stabroek Block to produce 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025, bolstered by up to 120,000 barrels of production from the Liza Phase 1 development starting in 2020. ExxonMobil began producing oil from its Liza Destiny floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) in December.  In addition to Guyana, Exxon is making multi-billion dollar investments in the growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that 50 countries will be importing LNG by 2025, up from 10 at the start of the century.Exxon is the operator of the $19 billion Papa New Guinea LNG Project, the operations of which have the capacity to produce over 8 million tonnes of LNG annually. In terms of other LNG projects, Exxon is ramping up investment in the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique. Recently announced in October 2019, the company plans to invest more than $500 million in the initial construction phase of the project which now has a capacity of over 15 million tonnes of LNG annually.  Exxon has also made bids for the \"pre-salt\" offshore blocks off the coast of Brazil, one of the largest discoveries over the past few decades. For the time being, uncertainty surrounds Exxon's involvement in these offshore blocks after the November 2019 asset auction went bust.  There's been a running theme for the large integrated oil and gas company: Divest away from stodgy, long-term payoff plays and into quick returns now available in the shale basins throughout the United States. For Exxon, the divestments are fairly extreme, totaling $4.8 billion against $8.7 billion in earnings, and capital expenditures of $22.7 billion as of the nine months ended Sept. 30.  Exxon operates a system from the wellhead to your car in an effort to balance the risks associated with just exploring for and producing hydrocarbons or solely refining them. The upstream side of oil and gas is typically termed a commodity business, whereas the downstream side is a margin game based on the lowest input cost for a barrel of oil and the highest output of gasoline and distillates. In early September 2019, the number of onshore operating drilling rigs in the United States fell below 900 for the first time since 2017. Today, the rig count is 800, more or less. The Baker Hughes Rig Count acts as a yardstick for onshore drilling contractors, which Exxon hires to drill new wells. Despite a trend of fewer rigs, Exxon has 55 operational rigs in the Permian Basin as of the third quarter of 2019, up from 51 in the second quarter and 46 in the first quarter. But that's just the upstream side. In addition to its rising upstream portfolio, Exxon has the second-largest refining capacity in the world. When crude prices are down, Exxon's refinery margins improve since low-priced Permian oil can feed cheaply and efficiently into Exxon's vast downstream refining infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. In terms of downstream growth, Exxon is currently developing 18 refining and petrochemical facilities. Next year, ExxonMobil will celebrate the 150-year anniversary of its predecessor, Standard Oil. In five years, Exxon plans to become one of the largest producers (if not the largest one) out of the Permian Basin. On the flip side, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), the world's largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, unveiled a 10-year savings and operations plan that reflects tighter spending in an effort to increase investor confidence by rewarding shareholders with strong dividends built upon consistent free cash flow. ConocoPhillips lowered its capital expenditure budget to roughly $7 billion per year through 2029. Total cash flow generation is expected to be $50 billion with a 3% annual output growth based on \"a real West Texas Intermediate price of $50 per barrel.\"   In addition to ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) is also cutting spending in an effort to deleverage its balance sheet after its acquisition of Anadarko. Occidental also estimated that its capital budget will decrease from $9.0 billion in 2019 to somewhere in the $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion range in 2020, which is expected to generate production growth of 2% in the year. Tying it all together, ExxonMobil is raising money from divestments to fund Permian Basin expansion projects aimed at producing hydrocarbons quickly and at a low cost that it can then feed into its immense refinery network. The company's quick return Permian assets aim to pair nicely with its large offshore projects and focus on LNG. Exxon should be able to make these investments while raising its dividend, as it has done for 37 consecutive years. The company has increased its dividend by more than 100% in the past 10 years alone. In sum, Exxon and Chevron could be able to pull ahead from independents like ConocoPhillips and Occidental as spending tightens for E&Ps. Although the last five years were tough on Exxon, it seems the company has adjusted well to the new energy environment and could have a bright future.  10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobilWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''.  These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n",

      "  After years of oversupply, oil prices are still only trending slightly upwards. Although the  of 2012-2014 are unlikely to return this year, investors should not be too quick to dismiss the sector. New tensions between the U.S. and Iran, following the killing of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, might trigger a resurgence in oil prices. A renewed boom in the oil markets requires two things to happen. First, oil prices must firm up and rise throughout 2020. Destabilization in the Middle East might speed up the rise in oil prices. Unfortunately, this will hurt other spaces like airlines, automobile manufacturing and consumer discretionary. Rising energy prices increase costs for such goods and would put pressure on demand. Second, OPEC must maintain or further lower output to keep energy prices high. So far, the Gulf Nations are keeping output constrained and are even cutting deliveries . To manage your portfolioÃ¢ÂÂs returns effectively, you will need to consider increasing your weighting in energy to offset a drop in the other sectors. With that said, here are seven energy stocks you should buy in light of a resurgence of the oil boom.    Stuck in a trading range for months, BP plcÃÂ (NYSE:) is an integrated oil and gas firm that steadily shed assets after the Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010. At these levels, the stock is a good income play for conservative investors and for those looking for steady retirement income. BP modeled oil prices to fall to the $40 Ã¢ÂÂ $50 range in the near-term. But because prices are now at the $60 level, investors should expect the company to bounce back sharply from its extremely weak third-quarter report. BP  year over year due to Ã¢ÂÂlower liquids and gas realizations.Ã¢ÂÂ Poor weather conditions hurt results too. Despite its weak quarter, BP continued to apply its underlying cash flow to buy back stock, pay a quarterly dividend and to cover its capex spend. Record results at its Whiting and Cherry Point refineries, plus expansion in the Spanish power market, suggest growth from diversified sources. This lowers BPÃ¢ÂÂs reliance on an oil price rebound. Investors may consider Q4 another headwind as it books costs. And since the market is forward-looking, the seasonal maintenance costs and turnaround activities for upstream will follow-up with revenue growth ahead. Similarly, BPÃ¢ÂÂs lower industry refining margins for downstream will reverse, too.    Similar to BP, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:) is stuck in a narrow trading range at around $70. The companyÃ¢ÂÂs asset sale improves its balance sheet, but higher oil prices will push profits to better levels. ExxonÃ¢ÂÂs  from Norway will raise $3.6 billion, offsetting weak performance for its refining and chemicals business. Oil production levels are still unchanged from the last quarter. Still, Q3 results are steady and have room to grow now that energy market prospects are improving. Exxon reported earnings of $3.2 billion. Cash flow jumped sharply from $6 billion in Q2 to $9.5 billion from Q3, due mostly to asset sales. Upstream global gas realizations are still a challenge, but growth in the Permian will help production. Investors should not expect Upstream rebounding by much, but the higher oil prices should still offset its underperformance. Income investors should praise Exxon managementÃ¢ÂÂs commitment to the dividend. The company raised the dividend by 6%, marking the 37th consecutive year of dividend growth. Management said : Ã¢ÂÂThe strength of our balance sheet provides us with the capacity to invest through the cycle with leverage at just 12%.Ã¢ÂÂ Ongoing commitments to projects like the one in Tengiz, despite the , is still of strategic importance for ExxonÃ¢ÂÂs long-term growth. But if Exxon leverages its scale and manages cost pressures, the project will add meaning to profits in the future.    Despite a big write-down, Chevron (NYSE:) stock is holding up. Markets are betting that the $10-$11 billion write-down is a one-time event that sets the bottom to ChevronÃ¢ÂÂs near-term costs. More than half of the write-down is related to the Appalachia shale unit. But by holding the $20 billion worth of organic capital spending levels, the company will benefit from a return on capital as the market improves. Chevron will take a disciplined cost control approach with gas-related opportunities. It said it Ã¢ÂÂwill reduce funding to various gas-related opportunities including Appalachia shale, Kitimat LNG, and other international projects.Ã¢ÂÂ CVX stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 17, which reflects investor appreciation over managementÃ¢ÂÂs candidness. But the honest commentary posted on the Dec. 10 press release happened when oil prices were still moving sideways. Now that the commodity is firming up, Chevron has a good chance of finding success as competitors with a weaker balance sheet flounder. Chevron has $2.8 billion budgeted for capital spending related to its downstream business. $1.6 billion will be spent on U.S downstream while international downstream will be $1.2 billion. Improving oil prices should give both the downstream and upstream markets a positive lift. The average price target on CVX stock is $138.88. Investors who forecast no revenue growth ahead in the next 10 years will arrive at an even  (from a finbox.io model) than analysts.    ConocoPhillips (NYSE:) pays investors a modest dividend in the 2.5% range and erased most of 2019Ã¢ÂÂs lows. Even after the strong performance on the market, the stock still trades in the sub-10 P/E multiple. At an analyst and investor  in November 2019, the company highlighted the 2012-14 oil price highs at $100 per barrel. It noted the energy sectorÃ¢ÂÂs weighting on in the S&P 500 fell from 12% to 4%. Despite the weakened importance of energy, ConocoPhillips believes it is resilient to the falling energy market. It allocates capital responsibly by measuring its return. The company posted 2019 full-year free cash flow (FCF) yield topping 9%. This had assumed oil would be at the consensus $57 per barrel. But low stock valuations and a higher return on capital at low oil prices suggest the stock will reward investors in 2020. COP noted the 12% return on capital for the full year is a strong turnaround from the negative 4% in 2016. Further, it : Ã¢ÂÂThe improvements across all these metrics set the stage for the 10-year plan youÃ¢ÂÂll see today. We are stronger now than we were three years ago and we plan to get stronger over the next decade and will keep our focus on these drivers of value.Ã¢ÂÂ Investors could ignore the unlikely scenario where the company does not grow in the next few years. In a dividend discount model with stable growth, COP stock  over $73 a share.    With a dividend that yields over 6%, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:) (NYSE:RDS.B) will appeal to both income investors and energy investors. In the third quarter, the company, best known for its Ã¢ÂÂShellÃ¢ÂÂ gas stations, posted strong cash flow generation. The Integrated Gas and Oil Products division contributed to the $12.1 billion in operations and free cash flow of $10.1 billion. Earnings of $4.8 billion were hurt by lower prices and margins. And although strong trading ahead will lift results, higher energy prices will help revenue grow faster than previously expected. Integrated gas added $2.7 billion in Royal DutchÃ¢ÂÂs $4.8 billion in earnings. Downstream added $2.2 billion in earnings. RDS will still grow its business even if the energy resurgence plays out slower than expected. When speaking about the liquefied natural gas market, : Ã¢ÂÂNot only do we expect growing demand, [but] we also see a supply gap emerging in the mid-2020s, once the current wave of new liquefaction capacity has been absorbed. Consequently, we are seeing continued interest in long-term contracts from LNG buyers.Ã¢ÂÂ It already established its market in Hong Kong after it signed long-term agreements from LNG buyers. As its LNG terminal services the Asian market, Royal Dutch may grow its cash flow and increase returns from a market outside of oil. LNG contracting will give the company a predictable revenue stream. Long-term contracts provide price stability. And for 2020, its price review has no changes. In fact, Royal Dutch already expects positive price changes and has its outlook ready for 2025.    Even after a steady uptrend, Enbridge (NYSE:) shares still pay a generous dividend. In fact, the company recently raised its dividend by 9.8% on Dec. 10. This boring pipeline company is a solid, long-term holding that investors should consider holding. Even though higher oil prices will not directly help Enbridge, the resurgence in the sector will give investors a reason to hold ENB stock. The company has resilient energy infrastructure in liquid pipelines, gas transmission and gas distribution in storage. Growing global demand for energy is undeniable. By 2040, demand will . According to ENB, this demand stems from world population growth of 27%, urbanization increasing 16% and the global middle class increasing 67%. Enbridge forecasts discounted cash flow per share of $4.50 Ã¢ÂÂ $4.80 in the full-year 2020. And beyond 2020, DCF/share growth will be in the range of 5% Ã¢ÂÂ 7%. The companyÃ¢ÂÂs priority on improving its balance sheet will lower risks for shareholders. Enbridge is aiming to have a Debt/EBITDA ratio at 4.5 times to below 5 times. Add the $6.5 billion in dividend payments in 2020 and organic growth and income investors will continue accumulating the stock.    HalliburtonÃ¢ÂÂs (NYSE:) revenue decline may end as the resurgence in oil begins. In the third quarter, revenue fell 6% to $5.6 billion, while earnings fell 3% to $536 million. Still, investors may anticipate international market strength continuing and a rebound in its North American business in 2020. Uncertainties in the period hurt supply and demand, led by Iran sanctions and production falling in Venezuela. Supply constraints, due to political instability in Africa and Latin America hurt Q3 results. But the Phase 1 U.S. and China trade deal should drive energy demand higher. Plus, HalliburtonÃ¢ÂÂs drilling and exploration business will have a strong return if the long-term global demand for energy trends higher. On its conference call, : Ã¢ÂÂOur Drilling and Evaluation division traditionally had the most exposure to international markets, with about 70% of division revenues coming from outside North America.Ã¢ÂÂ The industry is maximizing returns from mature fields. And as drilling activity expands, Halliburton has strong growth potential ahead, regardless of the surge in energy prices. The companyÃ¢ÂÂs 2020 outlook is bright. International topline and margin growth opportunities will increase. With a global slowdown unlikely, HAL stock will likely continue its uptrend that started in the last few months.

      " Everyone knows that Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) makes trucks, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) makes electric vehicles. But Rivian Automotive? What the heck is that? By the time 2020 is out, I suspect absolutely no one will be asking this question. If you haven't heard of Rivian Automotive yet, here's a quick rundown. Image source: Rivian Automotive. Based in Plymouth, Michigan, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence Rivian Automotive set up shop back in 2009 (although we didn't start hearing a lot about it until just last year). The company hasn't begun operations yet, really, but plans to begin selling its first two electric trucks, the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, in late 2020. Kelley Blue Book advises that both models will seat at least five passengers, with the R1S having an optional three-row, seven-passenger configuration. As all-electric vehicles, they will not have a gas engine -- but may not need one to allay consumers' range anxiety, because both vehicles will be rated for between 300 and 410 miles fully charged.   Because they're trucks, they'll boast significant towing capacity -- 11,000 pounds for the R1T and 7,700 pounds for the R1S. And because they're electric, they'll be able to go really fast when not towing a boat or camper -- accelerating from 0 to 60 in as little as three seconds. Neither truck will be cheap. Rivian expects to price the R1T at $69,000 to start, and the R1S at $72,500, both prices before state and federal tax credits. Now admittedly, none of this information will make much difference to consumers (or investors) if Rivian goes bust, or fails to produce the products it's promised. But recent financing rounds suggest that Rivian will in fact have the cash it needs to go the distance. Last year, for example, Rivian attracted a $700 million investment from a consortium led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which later awarded Rivian a contract to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans specially designed for Amazon's use. (Deliveries will begin in 2020 or 2021, and continue through 2024).   In swift succession, Rivian won a further $500 million investment from a company you'd think would consider it a rival -- Ford -- and $350 million from privately held Cox Automotive. Those investments alone probably would have been enough to make Rivian a viable contender to Tesla, which has an SUV of its own on the market already (Model X), and announced an electric pickup truck offering in November (Cybertruck). But in the waning days of December, Rivian won an even bigger investment -- more money than Ford and Amazon ponied up, combined. On Monday, December 23, Rivian announced it had secured a $1.3 billion investment from \"funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.\" With that money in hand, Rivian ended the year with nearly $3 billion in new funding. Given that the company already has a production plant to build in (Mitsubishi's old plant in Normal, Illinois), $3 billion should be just enough cash to develop the three closely related truck/van models revealed so far. According to autoblog.com, the average cost to develop new cars is about $1 billion per model.   Of course, the question still remains: Will Rivian's trucks sell? According to Wall Street Journal auto reporter Dan Neil, \"we are living through the S-curve of EV adoption,\" and 2020 could very well become the year of the electric \"car.\" That being said, there are going to be a lot of electric cars coming to market this year to choose from, with more than a dozen new models coming on line to compete with existing fare such as Tesla's Models S, 3, and X and Nissan's Leaf.   Although it's hard to keep track of all the moving parts, WSJ alone highlights Volvo's XC40 Recharge, Ford's Mustang Mach-E, and Mini's Mini Cooper SE as viable contenders in addition to Tesla's and Nissan's wares. At starting prices ranging from $60,500 (Ford) to just $30,750 (Mini), each of these new rivals underprices Rivian's offering.   One thing Rivian has got, however, that everyone else has not: Last week, Rivian released a video demonstrating its new \"tank turn\" feature that will be available for both the R1T and R1S. Like a modern main battle tank, the truck's four electric motors can spin in different directions, enabling the truck to literally turn on a dime -- spinning itself around a fixed point.   Probably thought up as a way to market the truck to off-roaders initially, this feature would also make Rivian's truck incredibly maneuverable in tight spaces, such as might be encountered on construction sites, in crowded driveways, and parking garages -- the latter perhaps a valuable selling point to suburban shoppers. Combined with the right software, I suspect Rivian's tank-turn feature will also make parallel parking in even the tightest spaces a breeze. Long story short, yes, this truck will sell. Now, all Rivian needs to do is build it.  10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Investing in a group of quality growth stocks and sticking with them for decades can lead to life-changing wealth. An investment of just $100 per month at an annualized return of 12% over 50 years can grow to $3.9 million.  Three stocks that can help you achieve those returns are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here's why these stocks should remain compounding machines for the next 50 years. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's Google is still benefiting from the shift of ad spending moving online. Its range of products and platforms, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, and Gmail, each have over one billion users. That's attractive to advertisers, and it's why Google is the No. 3 most valuable brand in the world, according to Brand Finance.  However, over the next 50 years, Alphabet will likely generate significant amounts of revenue from other businesses. The one analysts are watching heading into 2020 is Google Cloud. Google's \"other revenue\" that includes Google Cloud, Google Play, Google Home, and other hardware products has been Alphabet's fastest-growing segment in the last few years, and it may reach 20% of the company's total revenue in 2020.  There are not many companies as forward-thinking as Alphabet that have the resources to invest billions in new growth avenues. The company considers its investments in moonshot opportunities, or \"other bets,\" as vital to its future success. These other bets include potential world-changers, such as self-driving cars with Waymo, or growth opportunities in life sciences with Verily.  Don't let Alphabet's $992 billion market cap make you think the stock has already run its course. The company has more than doubled its revenue and earnings over the last five years, and given its forward-thinking corporate culture, Alphabet should continue to grow for many years. Moving one spot below Google on Brand Finance's most valuable brand list is Microsoft, at No. 4. The software giant has been making essential tools for people to get stuff done for decades. Microsoft has over 900 million Windows 10 users. Under CEO Sadya Nadella, the company has spread its reach well beyond the PC to mobile devices and the cloud. Microsoft has the brand recognition, network effect advantage, and resources to continue winning in the markets it serves. Its Office software is still in high demand after all these years. Even though Apple has 1.4 billion users of its devices, the familiarity people have with Apple's software hasn't dethroned Microsoft's Word and Excel. Office commercial products, including 365 subscriptions, have been growing fast, up 25% year over year in the most recent quarter.  Also, businesses are continuing to use cloud-based tools to handle IT services. The infrastructure-as-a-service cloud market is expected to grow three times faster than traditional IT services through 2022, according to Gartner. Microsoft Azure has tremendous momentum in this space, with revenue surging 59% year over year in the last quarter.  Microsoft has proven it can adapt its basic software services to the cloud and develop new cloud-based platforms for businesses, such as Dynamics 365 and Azure. The ability to adapt to changing environments in technology gives me confidence that the company will still be around in 50 years. It offers good growth prospects, high margins, and a growing stream of dividends. Owning the stock seems like a no-brainer for the 21st century. Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Tesla is not short of investor attention. The stock has experienced a meteoric rise since its initial public offering in 2010, but the sky truly is the limit for Elon Musk's company. Some on Wall Street are debating whether it's time to sell the stock after the share price more than doubled off of its lows last year. But I think long-term investors should stay the course, and if you don't already own shares, you should consider starting a small position. Tesla is at the center of a secular trend sweeping the world, as alternative forms of energy are increasingly in demand for everything from how homes are built to what fuels our cars. Tesla is known for its Model S, Model X, and Model 3 electric vehicles, but it defines its mission as helping the world accelerate to sustainable energy through various energy products, including solar electricity. The company has installed thousands of solar products for consumers since 2006, and last year, it released Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.  You can't underestimate a visionary leader like Musk, who has demonstrated a great talent for seeing an opportunity and starting a business to capture it. As Tesla approaches a $100 billion market cap, the company still has a tiny share of the nearly 100 million vehicles shipped in the industry every year. There were about 367,500 Tesla vehicles delivered in 2019, for an increase of 50% year over year. That growth is thanks to the Model 3, which went into production in 2017 and comes at a much more affordable price for the masses.  However, Musk believes the upcoming Model Y will outsell the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined. As Tesla releases more models, builds Gigafactories around the world, increases scale, and brings prices down for these cars, it's inevitable the company will hit the one-million delivery mark at some point. There is enormous upside for the Tesla brand over the next 50 years. All three stocks are already large caps, but each could keep heading higher from here. Consider that Coca-Cola started in 1886, but the stock is still increasing in value for shareholders. Walt Disney was started in 1923, but the stock is up 355% over the last 10 years. Great growth stocks continue to find ways to deliver returns for shareholders, and I believe Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla will be no different.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " In January, a lot of investors go hunting for new stocks to buy. Some need to put money into their retirement accounts before April 15. Others are trying to put their end-of-year bonuses or holiday gift money to work. But rushing to pick investments can lead to picking poor investments. The better strategy may be to work on developing a watch list of stocks even before you're ready to invest, so you'll be ready to buy one when the time is right. This month, stocks that you might want to keep an eye on without buying include companies facing uncertainty, such as U.S. oil stocks ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), as well as aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE: BA). Then there's a stock that might be too expensive to pick up right now -- electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).   Keeping an eye on top prospects can help you buy when the time is right. Image source: Getty Images. Oil prices ended 2019 with a sustained three-month rally that pushed them more than 10% above where they stood at the beginning of October. Many oil production stocks responded with rallies of their own. Shares of the largest independent U.S. exploration and production company, ConocoPhillips, rose 14.1% in the fourth quarter. This month, though, has served up a heaping helping of uncertainty, thanks in part to the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran. After the U.S. assassination of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, oil prices spiked briefly, with Brent crude briefly topping $70 a barrel. Prices have eased a bit in the days since, but the potential for volatility remains.  Depending on how the situation unfolds, oil prices could go up...or down. The impact could be amplified for U.S. oil companies that do business in the Middle East, particularly ExxonMobil and Chevron, which have major Persian Gulf operations. ConocoPhillips, on the other hand, which has no Middle East oil presence, could fare better in the event that the regional instability worsens. All energy investors should be keeping watch on this situation, but given the uncertainties, smart investors should probably just watch, and neither buy nor sell just yet. It's worth remembering that after the drone attack on one of Saudi Arabia's key oil facilities in September, oil prices spiked briefly, but quickly returned to their prior levels, leaving no lasting impact.  Troubled aerospace giant Boeing closed out a rocky 2019 by firing its CEO. This month, it's hoping to make significant progress toward getting its grounded 737 MAX aircraft back in the air. Unfortunately, the timing on that is not up to Boeing, but various governments' regulatory agencies. In addition, Boeing needs to hammer out deals to compensate customers that have been impacted by fleet downtime and delivery delays.  Working against Boeing are allegations that it was too cozy with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration during the initial review and testing phase of the new aircraft. That perception has put added pressure on regulators to take a harder-than-standard look at potential problems this time around. And in fact, according to The New York Times, new potential design flaws have been uncovered in the wiring of the airplane's tail: an issue completely unrelated to the flaws in the MCAS system that caused the two deadly 737 MAX crashes, which resulted in the model's grounding. In good news for the company, it has reached agreements with several key customers including Southwest and American Airlines regarding reimbursement for the revenue losses associated with the grounding of the fleet. However, if the grounding drags on, or if more issues are uncovered, Boeing could be on the hook for more. Here's a stock price chart of four major automakers -- Ford, Toyota, General Motors, and Tesla -- for the last three months:  TSLA data by YCharts Even if the chart didn't have the legend, you'd probably be able to guess that of those four companies, the blue line -- showing a stock price that's more than doubled -- belongs to Tesla. Its shares were buoyed as analysts reconsidered their stance on the potential for its unusual CyberTruck and the company's prospects in China. In the wake of that rise, Tesla's share price of about $466 is by far its highest ever, and its market cap of $84.1 billion is roughly equal to GM's and Ford's combined.  That said, investing is an endeavor for years and decades, not months, and the bigger picture matters. Step back a bit, and one sees that up until October, Tesla was actually having a very bad 2019.  TSLA data by YCharts So the big question for investors is, will this current rally continue? Or will the company's ongoing issues -- a lack of profitability, unfavorable product mix, and high debt load -- throw cold water on shareholders' hopes?  When a company's share price performance has been this volatile, buying at the top can seem like a risky prospect. Yet investors will want to keep an eye on Tesla in case a more attractive entry point presents itself... and, historically speaking, that has tended to happen at least once every few months. Even if you need to make a big contribution to your tax-advantaged retirement account before April 15 rolls around, remember -- that's four months away. You don't need to rush to pick an investment right now. But developing a robust watch list of top stocks that you might want to buy under the right circumstances can help you make better decisions. This month, putting Tesla, Boeing, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, and ExxonMobil on your radar screen may be a better move than putting them directly into your portfolio.  10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "  The new year and the new decade ahead will give investors a chance to start fresh, or at least an opportunity to commit to investing resolutions. When it comes to stock wins and losses, investors who did not sell the latter group will not have any capital losses to write off. But after the S&P 500 returned close to 30% in the year alone, meaning risks are higher than normal that 2020 will have at least one correction. The reasoning for a small correction is simple: Reversion to the mean is more likely. Investors need not panic about a potential market drop, but they may minimize the damage by following seven basic investing resolutions for 2020.  For fundamental investors, valuations matter in general. Microsoft (NASDAQ:) may sport a high price-to-earnings ratio, but that does not mean the stock will correct lower. Microsoft continues to report exceptionally strong software sales and growing cloud business. Subscription growth for Office 365 is unlikely to stall in 2020. So, MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂs P/E of over 31 times is easily justified. GameStop (NYSE:) trades at just 0.6 times book and has a forward P/E just under 12. The stock is cheap, yet this does not imply the stock is a value holding. Digital game downloads from Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:) and from Steam are hurting game sales at GameStop. Whatever valuation investors choose, stick to a range that you find suitable and have the discipline to buy and sell. If, for example, Tesla (NASDAQ:) at a forward P/E of over 75 times understates its future growth, then continue holding the stock. Conversely, if you believe TeslaÃ¢ÂÂs capital cost requirements will grow so fast that the company will keep losing money, avoid the stock. The bottom line here is that Tesla is an example of a stock that enjoyed a solid rally in the second half of 2019. And if market indexes fall on profit-taking, selling pressure on Tesla may accelerate. Microsoft stock may dip, too, but investors may average down in the stock. That strategy would pay off if the market rebounds and if Microsoft continues to report strong subscription growth throughout 2020.  Looking at out-of-favor sectors will pay off if the undervaluation compensates investors for the risks in betting on an eventual recovery. The technology sector was one of many shining areas of the market in the last year. As it rose, markets ignored the rebound in oil prices. Chances are good thatÃÂ the sector will rebound further in 2020. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:, NYSE:RDS.B) fell as low as $56 in the last few months but promptly rebounded back to $60. With the prospects of energy prices recovering with the support of stronger global growth, RDS is a stock to consider. It pays a dividend that yields over 6%. BP (NYSE:) is also trading in a narrow range and pays a dividend that yields 6.5%. The drug manufacturing sector is another beat-up sector that is out of favor. Teva Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:) is starting to win its investorsÃ¢ÂÂ confidence. Management is stabilizing the business and applying much of its cash flow to pay down its debt. If the government allows for higher drug prices, TevaÃ¢ÂÂs revenue may stop falling. And if generic competition on TevaÃ¢ÂÂs Copaxone lessens, the stock could start at $10 as the bottom.    Avoiding stocks that reached all-time highs in the last year may work if markets really peaked at the end of 2019. If profit-taking picks up at the start of 2020, investors buying Apple (NASDAQ:) at all-time highs might face paper losses for a few years. In effect, investors are at the mercy of the markets trending higher. If that does not happen, and if Apple reports weak iPhone 11 sales, its stock may give up its 85% gains. Even though I said Microsoft is a buy based on its relative valuation, the stock also ran up to all-time highs recently. Investors are getting no margin of safety, especially when the stock is widely held in many mutual funds and index exchange-traded funds. Rite AidÃ¢ÂÂs (NYSE:) monstrous run-up to $24 is another example of a stock to avoid at the peak. With a short float of over 25%, a violent squeeze led to the stockÃ¢ÂÂs pop after its earnings report. Fundamentals of this drugstore chain improved in the last quarter, surprising short sellers. So, after the drop from the peak, investors may want to consider Rite Aid stock at better levels. A better idea would be to wait for Rite AidÃ¢ÂÂs next earnings report. If it posts improving same-store sales again, then the stock is a compelling investment.  Peter Lynch once said that if you canÃ¢ÂÂt explain why youÃ¢ÂÂre investing in a company on a postcard, then donÃ¢ÂÂt invest in it. The biotechnology sector is fraught with danger for investors who do not understand the difference between drug discovery and drug sales. A drug discovery company has no revenue and applies all of its funded cash to research and development. Dermira (NASDAQ:) is an example of a company that reported positive clinical results for its atopic dermatitis research. Its shares nearly doubled from 52-week lows. XBiotech (NASDAQ:) also reported positive clinical data in the last few quarters. On Dec. 7, it sold its antibody discovery program to Janssen. Do you have the basic science background to follow clinical studies? Do you see a path to profitability for early-stage drug developers in the biotechnology space? If you do, then find and hold a basket of several drug stocks in this space for diversification. For everyone else, hold drug manufacturing stocks that generate consistently strong cash flow. I picked ÃÂ Regeneron (NASDAQ:) throughout 2019 for that reason. AbbVie (NYSE:), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:) are examples of stocks that are easier to understand. Of course, with Pfizer and AbbVie at all-time highs, investors might want to wait for a pullback.    In the last decade, buying Fitbit (NYSE:), GoPro (NASDAQ:) or Groupon (NASDAQ:) would have led to disastrous losses. These companies timed their stock listing at the peak of their respective hype. And when the fad ended, so did the marketÃ¢ÂÂs euphoria for their stock. For 2020, avoid fad stocks. Stocks that recently went public might happen to be fad stocks, with consumer demand for their products on the decline. Peloton (NASDAQ:) stock peaked at $36 in December 2019. Selling accelerated after a viral ad created a mixed but largely negative reaction. But fundamentals for Peloton could deteriorate if discretionary spending weakens in 2020. The Peloton exercise bike is a few thousand dollars and requires a monthly subscription. If owners cancel their service due to a lack of interest, PelotonÃ¢ÂÂs revenue growth would plunge. Canada Goose (NYSE:) is a potential fad company whose product is facing weakening demand. Still, Hong Kong is an important region for the winter jacket maker. The company forecast weak performance ahead due to the unrest. Lululemon (NASDAQ:) looked like a fad stock a few years ago but as its highs indicate, that is not true. Lululemon continues to report strong earnings every year.  Technology stocks were star sectors in the last year. Most of the high-flying stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Facebook (NASDAQ:) reinvested earnings back in the business or bought back stock. Yet if growth slows, investors end up holding underperforming shares. So, for 2020, investors should focus on holding stocks that pay dividends. Dividend-paying stocks distribute earnings to investors instead of retaining them. This gives investors a stream of regular dividend income. And it becomes a core source of returns should stocks move nowhere or head lower. Disney (NYSE:), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:) and AbbVie are some dividend-paying stocks to consider. They have an even balance of dividend yield and stock appreciation potential. The energy sector pays a richer dividend yield but due to its cyclical nature, it is riskier. If you happen to believe that the energy cycle is back to its growth phase, then Exxon (NYSE:) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:) are the big mega-capitalization names to look at in 2020.  Cable companies look stale and are operating in mature-phase markets. Newspapers, magazines and books are declining markets that investors should avoid. Dig deeper into companies that at first look like they are operating in a mature business. Then evaluate their overall growth potential as the business pivots. Comcast (NASDAQ:) is not just a boring cable company. It has an internet business that is growing nicely, an amusement park and NBC. The company is pivoting its business into the new-age sectors. Very recently, rumors surfaced that Comcast will buy a free streaming service called Xumo. This would fit nicely ahead of its launch of Peacock, a free streaming service. Comcast is dealing with the loss of traditional cable subscribers by looking at it from an NBC perspective. Big affiliate renewal deals will come up in 2021. Plus, Comcast is always looking at its contribution to profits. Even after rising by over 30% in the last year, Comcast trades at a forward P/E of 13.5 times. If its streaming business takes off, markets may reward the stock with a higher valuation. As of this writing, Chris Lau owns shares of BP. The post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.

      " Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are rising again on Wednesday, extending an extraordinary climb for the stock recently. Including the stock's intraday 6.4% gain as of 11:15 a.m. EST on Wednesday, shares are up more than 140% over the past four months. The stock's sharp gain on Wednesday follows yet another analyst's decision to increase his 12-month price target for the electric-car maker's stock ahead of earnings on Jan. 29. Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors on Wednesday that he believes the company's fourth-quarter earnings and its guidance for vehicle deliveries will not disappoint investors when Tesla reports results later this month. He believes there's robust demand for vehicles in China and Europe. Further, he is particularly bullish on the company's opportunity in China following the start of production at the company's Shanghai factory earlier this year. The opportunity for Tesla in the China market is worth $100 to $300 per share, Ives estimates. The analyst boosted his price target for the stock to $550 -- up from a $370 price target previously. The analyst has a neutral rating on the stock. In addition to reporting its financial results for its fourth quarter on Jan. 29, Tesla will also likely provide guidance for vehicle deliveries in 2020. The automaker saw deliveries rise 50% year over year in 2019, and investors are expecting more sharp growth this year.

      " ConocoPhillips' (NYSE: COP) new strategy continues to pay big dividends for its shareholders. That was evident in its recent announcement that it will provide investors with a massive dividend increase as well as keep buying back its stock. It's now the company's fourth dividend increase since launching its new strategy in late 2016. It likely won't be the last, given the company's focus on sending an increasing supply of its cash flow back to its investors. ConocoPhillips unveiled its 2020 capital return plans this week. The highlight was a monster 38% increase in its quarterly dividend. That will boost the yield up past 3%. That's a much higher level than most of its upstream-focused peers, which typically offer yields of around 1%. Image source: Getty Images. This year's raise is much larger than the company has typically provided its investors since it reset its dividend in early 2016. The company's first increase from that reset level came a year later when it raised its payout by 6%. It followed that up with two more last year, boosting the payout by 7.5% in February and another 7% in December. With its latest raise, the dividend is now 68% above where it was in early 2016, though it's still about 43% below its peak level in 2015. Driving ConocoPhillips' massive dividend increase is the \"significant transformation our company has undergone over the past few years,\" according to CEO Ryan Lance. He noted: \"Since announcing our returns-focused value proposition in 2016, we have improved our underlying performance drivers and lowered our sustaining price for the business. Given these enhancements, we are confident we can fund a higher, growing cash dividend, while maintaining a substantial, consistent buyback program.\" Speaking of share repurchases, ConocoPhillips also announced its intention to buy back another $3 billion in stock next year. On the one hand, that's down from the $3.5 billion it plans to repurchase this year. However, the total cash return will remain the same, since the company's increased dividend will cost it an additional $500 million next year. ConocoPhillips is one of several U.S. oil companies that have provided their investors with big-time dividend increases this year. Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD) has been among the leaders. The Permian Basin-focused oil company doubled its dividend in February as part of its plan to return more cash to investors. The company would go on to boost its payout again in August, this time by another 175%. With that latest increase, Pioneer's dividend has grown by a jaw-dropping 2,100% since the company started boosting it in 2017. However, even with that big-time increase, Pioneer's dividend yield is only 0.7%, which is well below the average of stocks in the S&P 500. EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), meanwhile, has also made it a priority to increase its payout. In May, the company boosted its dividend by 31%. Add that to the two increases it delivered in 2018, and EOG's payout has jumped 72% in the past two years. That's all part of the company's plan to increase its dividend yield closer to the S&P 500's average of 2%. With its payout currently around 1.6%, the company's dividend still has more high-octane growth ahead. The reason a growing number of oil companies are making dividend growth a priority is that investors are growing tired of the oil sector's chronic underperformance. Oil producers thought that production growth would fuel higher stock prices. Instead, all that excess output weighed on crude prices, which pushed down their stock market values. That failed strategy is leading a growing number of producers to allocate more cash to shareholder returns instead of to growth in hopes of creating more value for their investors. It's an approach that worked well for ConocoPhillips last year, which is why the company and its peers are sticking with a strategy that's delivering results. ConocoPhillips is working hard to win back dividend investors following its decision to reset the payout level in early 2016 to better cope with lower crude prices. With its latest raise, the company once again pays a well-above-average dividend. Meanwhile, given its priority of returning more cash to investors, the payout should continue growing in the coming years. That makes it a much more compelling option for income-focused investors to consider buying.  10 stocks we like better than ConocoPhillipsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) jumped on Tuesday, rising 6.5% as of 11:10 a.m. EST. The gain follows one analyst's decision to significantly increase his 12-month price target for the stock based on the company's recent execution and his expectations for more sharp sales growth from the electric-car company in the coming years. Image source: The Motley Fool. New Street analyst Pierre Ferragu gave Tesla stock an $800 12-month price target on Tuesday. This is up from his previous 12-month price target of $530. Supporting the stock's 80% gain over the last year has been the company's \"technological dominance, strong sustained demand, Tesla's ability to execute,\" said Ferragu in a note to investors.  Looking ahead, Ferragu thinks Tesla's annual deliveries can increase from a run rate of about 450,000 today to 2 million to 3 million units by 2025. In addition, the analyst believes the company will boast \"industry leading margins.\" Tesla stock's wild gain recently means investors will be watching closely when the automaker reports fourth-quarter results on Jan. 29. Investors will be looking for another profitable quarter and guidance for more strong growth in deliveries in 2020.

      " Oil companies have a spotty history as dividend stocks. The sector was once an excellent place for income-seeking investors to get above-average yields. However, when oil prices fell off their triple-digit perch a few years ago, it took many of the sector's dividends down with it. The industry has worked hard since that time to deal with its new reality of lower oil prices by cutting costs. These efforts have been paying dividends. That has allowed producers to begin sending more cash to their investors once again. And that means income-focused investors should start paying closer attention to this sector. Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy (NYSE: WPX) has been working hard over the past few years to reshape its business. The company sold several assets to reduce debt as well as finance its expansion program in the low-cost, oil-rich Permian Basin. Those moves were all part of a strategy to begin returning cash to its investors by 2021.  Last year was a pivotal one for the oil and gas company as it reached its debt reduction target. The company entered 2019 needing oil to average only about $50 a barrel to fund its expansion plan. However, thanks to higher oil prices, additional asset sales, excellent operating results, and a needle-moving acquisition, WPX Energy was able to accelerate its capital return program. It started by authorizing a $400 million share repurchase program in August. It has since initiated a quarterly dividend, which it will begin paying after closing its latest acquisition. While that payout's implied yield of 0.8% might not be all the appealing to income-seeking investors, WPX Energy should have the fuel to grow its dividend at a healthy rate in the coming years, which makes it more attractive.  Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy is joining many of its peers in starting small. However, what these payouts have lacked in size, they've more than made up for with growth. Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), for example, initiated a small dividend last year, which yielded around 0.5%. The company boosted that payout by 50% earlier this year and now yields about 0.9%. With Diamondback on track to generate a gusher of free cash in 2020 if oil remains at its current level, it will probably give its investors another sizable raise next year as well as buy back a big chunk of its stock.  Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD), meanwhile, had been paying its investors a paltry dividend for many years. However, the company started increasing it at a rapid pace in 2018. This year alone, Pioneer doubled its payout in February and then boosted it by another 175% in August. As a result, it has now increased its dividend by an eye-popping 2,100% in the last two years, driving its yield up to 1.2%. Oil giants ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), likewise, have boosted their payouts at impressive rates. ConocoPhillips was one of several oil stocks that slashed its dividend as a result of crashing crude prices a few years ago. However, it has been growing at an accelerated rate in recent years. The company started with a 6% increase in 2016 and followed that up with two more last year -- 7.5% in February and another 7% in December -- before giving its investors a monster 38% raise this October. With that latest increase, ConocoPhillips now yields an above-average 2.7%. EOG Recourses, on the other hand, kept its payout flat during the darkest days of the oil market downturn. It has since restarted its dividend growth engine, giving its investors two raises last year and another 31% increase this year. As a result, it now yields about 1.5%. More high-octane growth, however, is up ahead, given that the company aims to push its yield up to at least the level of the S&P 500, which is around 2%. While most oil stocks don't pay high yields these days, many are growing their payouts at rapid rates. That's noteworthy, considering that dividend growth stocks have historically produced the highest total returns. That's why income investors might want to consider adding a dividend-paying oil stock to their portfolio since they could generate some high-octane total returns in the coming years as they keep increasing their payouts at a fast pace.  10 stocks we like better than ConocoPhillipsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

November natural gas futures fell 2 cents to $2.22 per 1 million BTU.  Among energy stocks moving on news:  (+) Total SA (TOT) advanced more than 1% after the French energy major said it won Thursday's final bidding round for the C-M-541 deep-water exploration block in the Campos basin offshore of Brazil. Total will operate the block with a 40% interest, while Qatar Petroleum also will hold a 40% stake in the project and Petronas owning the remaining 20%. The group is expecting to drill its first exploration well in the C-M-541 block in 2021.  In other sector news: (+) ProPetro Holding (PUMP) was surging Thursday, climbing 20%, after the hydraulic-fracturing services company said an internal review did not uncover any items that would require a restatement of its prior financial results.

He succeeds Jeffrey Smith, who became chief administrative officer as part of a broader management realignment at ProPetro. (+) Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) rose 2.5% on Thursday after a Mizuho Securities upgrade of the oil and natural gas producer to buy from neutral.

      "  The S&P 500's dividend stocks provided shareholders with an average payout boost of more than 8% in 2019. However, a number of outstanding companies announced far more substantial dividend increases - 20%, 30% or more. In a few cases, companies more than doubled their payouts overnight. Companies often authorize significant upgrades in their regular dividends to attract new investors or stand out from industry competitors. While one-time influxes of cash will often go toward buybacks or one-time special dividends, firms that believe they can maintain heightened levels of profitability will return some of that money through larger regular payouts. You'll notice that many of the past year's largest dividend increases came from the banking industry. That's in part because some large banks that were sitting on stockpiles of cash received permission from government regulators to distribute their excess capital to investors. Another major impetus for dividend growth was tax reform, which bumped up after-tax profits for many American companies, including banks. Here, we look at 30 companies that stood out over the past year because of their outsize dividend increases. Each dividend growth stock listed here improved its regular payout by at least 20% in 2019, though in numerous cases, the dividend improved by considerably more. Let's take a look.  Market value: $306.7 billion Dividend yield: 2.1% 2019 dividend increase: 20% Bank of America (BAC, $34.71) is America's second largest money-center bank by market capitalization, behind only $426 billion JPMorgan Chase (JPM). BofA is tops, however, in market share of consumer deposits, and it also claims to be the country's leading digital bank. Thanks to ready access to low-cost funding, Bank of America has been able to boost its earnings assets by double digits over the past few years while using less regulatory capital. The bank finished 2019 with a decent fourth quarter in which net income grew about 6% to 70 cents per share. It closed out the year with assets totaling $2.43 trillion and deposits of $1.43 trillion. Bank of America's most recent dividend hike was announced in July\" a 20% improvement to a new quarterly rate of 18 cents per share. The cash distribution has exploded over the past five years by 260%, but it sprang from a lowly position. BofA's dividend shrank from 64 cents in 2008 to a penny in 2009, and the company only restarted its dividend growth in 2014, when it jumped to 5 cents per share. A meager payout ratio of 24% (that is, 24% of BofA's profits go toward paying the dividend) leaves a wide margin of safety and plenty of room for future dividend growth.  Market value: $1.1 billion Dividend yield: 1.9% 2019 dividend increase: 20% First Bancorp (FBNC, $38.39) is the fourth largest bank headquartered in North Carolina. Founded in 1935, this community bank has $6.1 billion in assets and approximately 100 branch locations across both Carolinas. The bank plans to expand its footprint in North Carolina's most populous markets, which include Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Raleigh and Charlotte, while upgrading its technology. Last year, First Bancorp launched new bill pay systems, mortgage-driven loan apps and call centers. In 2020, the bank plans to introduce new credit card lending and retail banking platforms. Reflecting the strength of its Carolina metro markets, First Bancorp has generated roughly 34% annual earnings growth over the past half-decade, and it has consistently beaten analyst consensus EPS estimates every quarter since 2015. First Bancorp announced two dividend hikes in 2019 - though only one, a 20% increase to 12 cents per share, took effect last year. The second announcement, made at the end of December, was a much more significant enhancement to 18 cents per share, or a 50% hike. That surely will rank among 2020's largest dividend increases. Like BofA, a meager payout ratio (23%) gives the company ample room to keep hiking its payouts.  Market value: $11.4 billion Dividend yield: 1.5% 2019 dividend increase: 20% Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII, $277.81) was one of 16 companies awarded huge contracts by the Defense Intelligence Agency in September for analytical and operational support services. The multiyear contract has a five-year base period and a potential value of $17 billion. That news sparked short-term optimism in the stock and was one of several drivers of the company's 32% market-beating gains last year. Huntington Ingalls delivered more good news when it reported its September quarter, including 7% revenue growth due to acquisitions and higher production volume at its Newport News ship-building yard. Contract backlog at the end of September was $39.2 billion, up 70% from year-end 2018. HII also generated $250 million of free cash flow, $103 million of which was distributed to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Earnings per share declined by 29% due mainly to accounting adjustments and higher pension costs, but its profits still were higher than consensus analyst estimates. A couple days prior to reporting these results, Huntington Ingalls announced a 20% bump in its payout to $1.03 per share. It also announced a $1 billion increase to its share repurchase program, and extended the timeline of that plan from Oct. 31, 2022, to Oct. 31, 2024. The company's payout ratio is a prudent 24%, and it has been a generous dividend growth stock, averaging 39% raises annually over the past half-decade.  Market value: $5.9 billion Dividend yield: 3.0% 2019 dividend increase: 20% Synovus Financial (SNV, $40.00) became the Southeast's fifth largest bank last year by acquiring Florida Community Bank. Today, the bank has $48 billion of assets and a network of roughly 300 branches across Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida. The merger expanded Synovus' presence in fast-growing areas of Florida that now represent one-third of its franchise. In addition, the company broadened its wealth management and brokerage capabilities, gained new cross-selling opportunities and leveraged its technology investment across a broader footprint. Synovus has produced 22% annual EPS growth over the past five years and regularly outperforms regional peers on profit metrics such as net interest margin (NIM), return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Its robust financial growth has been redistributed to shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend that has expanded by well more than 24% annually. That includes a 20% hike announced in mid-January 2019. A payout ratio of 34% implies a safe dividend with flexibility to grow.  Market value: $282.8 billion Dividend yield: 1.5% 2019 dividend increase: 20% UnitedHealth Group (UNH, $298.47) is the American market leader in managed health-care plans and benefits. The company provides health-care coverage and related services to more than 137 million individuals and is one of the nation's largest providers of Medicare Advantage plans. Through its OptumHealth business, the company also offers technology-enabled health services, including prescription drug services. UnitedHealth has been a marvel of predictability, delivering 11% sales growth and roughly 14% EPS growth annually over the past decade. That included a 7% improvement on the top line and a 17% boost to the bottom line in 2019. The result: $18.5 billion in cash flows from operations across the year. And thanks to strong recurring revenues, UNH has high earnings visibility. It's guiding for high-single-digit sales and profit growth in 2020. UnitedHealth has raised its dividend by 20% for three consecutive years, and the payout has been on the rise annually since 2010.  Market value: $454.9 billion Dividend yield: 0.6% 2019 dividend increase: 20% Visa (V, $204.70) is the world leader in digital payments. During its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2019, the company processed 138.3 billion payments for 15,500 financial institution clients. Visa's total payments and cash volume grew to $11.6 trillion, and more than 3.4 billion Visa cards were available for use worldwide and accepted at more than 61 million merchant locations. The company see growth opportunities in its core credit, debit and pre-paid card products as a result of $17 trillion in consumer spending and $15 billion to $20 billion of business-to-business (B2B) spending still done in cash and checks. Visa also plans to accelerate its migration into digital payments with new products for B2B, person-to-person (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C) and government-to-consumer (G2C) payments. Visa's revenues improved by 11% in fiscal 2019, fueling a 20% rise in EPS. That came as a result of new client partnerships, organic investments and acquisitions. Recent M&A activity included a cross-border payment processor (Earthport) and a point-of-sale payment software developer (Payworks). Visa is guiding for low double-digit 2020 revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth. Visa is gaining a reputation among dividend growth stocks. Its 20% dividend hike in 2019 was right in line with its five-year average and marked the company's 11th consecutive improvement. A modest payout ratio of 19% should enable the company to keep the pedal down.  Market value: $885.8 million Dividend yield: 3.4% 2019 dividend increase: 21% Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp. (AGM, $82.70), also known as \"Farmer Mac,\" lends to farmers and ranchers across rural America. The company offers loans secured by first liens on agricultural real estate, agricultural and rural development loans secured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as loans that help cooperatives finance rural telecom and electric systems. Over the past decade, Farmer Mac's loan volume has grown by nearly 11% annually. Despite robust loan growth, Farmer Mac holds only a 6% share of the expanding $245 billion agricultural credit market. Significant market growth is expected as a result of rising worldwide food demand; to feed the world's growing population, American farm productivity must double over the next 30 years. Farmer Mac plans to leverage its lower cost of funds - a major competitive advantage - to gain market share. Farmer Mac's profit growth has been much more modest than the previous companies on this list, at about 7.5% annually. Still, it has been able to afford robust dividend increases of about 38% annually over the past half-decade; last year's hike came to 21%. Despite that, AGM shares boast a modest payout ratio of just 34% of the company's profits.  Market value: $66.4 billion Dividend yield: 3.0% 2019 dividend increase: 21% PNC Financial Services (PNC, $153.36) provides retail banking services to more than 8 million retail customers across the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. Its digital footprint is built around its well-known \"Virtual Wallet\" product. The company also offers corporate banking to clients that include two-thirds of the Fortune 500 companies, and its asset management business oversees just less than $300 billion in assets. PNC also owns a minority stake in BlackRock (BLK), one of the world's largest investment management firms. 2019 was a relatively slow year for the company, however. Revenues improved by just 4%, while net income ticked just 1.3% higher. The company's fourth-quarter earnings managed to top estimates, though Wall Street knocked shares lower on worries about increasing costs. Still, PNC has delivered 3.5% annual growth in assets, 5% yearly EPS growth and nearly 6% gains in book value per share. But the company is sharing increasing amounts of its wealth to shareholders. PNC announced a $1 billion increase to its share-buyback plan, through the end of Q2 2020. It also announced a 21% dividend hike in July to $1.15 per share - a little higher than its 19% five-year annual average.  Market value: $128.6 billion Dividend yield: 2.1% 2019 dividend increase: 21% Union Pacific (UNP, $185.32) operates the Union Pacific Railroad - a rail network connecting 23 states in the western U.S. Its rail system serves many of the fastest-growing American population centers, as well as all of the major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports and eastern gateways. It also connects with Canada's rail systems, and it's the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. Moreover, UNP provides rail freight services for more than 10,000 customers primarily involved in the agricultural, energy and manufacturing industries. The trade war with China negatively impacted the company's September quarter results, leading to a 7% year-over-year decline in freight volume. That said, EPS still improved by 3% thanks to operating efficiencies and $1.1 billion worth of share repurchases during the quarter. Union Pacific did guide for a 10% volume decline in the December quarter, however, which caused analysts to reduce consensus 2019 EPS estimates. (The company's Q4 results are due out Jan. 23.) Recent trade war issues have interrupted an otherwise excellent past performance which had Union Pacific generating 14% yearly EPS gains over the past decade. The company has also been a consistent dividend growth stock; its payouts have improved for 13 years in a row, including at 14% annual clip over the past five years. UNP offered up a pair of hikes in 2019 - first from 80 cents per share to 88 cents in March, then again to 97 cents in September, which was good for a total jump of about 21%.  Market value: $9.3 billion Dividend yield: 1.2% 2019 dividend increase: 25% Carlisle Companies (CSL, $163.95) owns a portfolio of niche brands and businesses that manufacture highly engineered products for the roofing, aerospace, medical, defense, transportation, industrial, agriculture, mining and construction industries. The company delivered a stellar September quarter performance, with sales up 8% year-over-year, its 26th consecutive quarter of sales growth. EPS from continuous operations rocketed 52%. Carlisle benefited from price increases, cost savings and acquisitions in its construction materials business, and a favorable sales mix in its interconnect technologies segment. This reliable performer has delivered 9% annual sales growth and 10% yearly EPS gains over the past five years. Carlisle is a spectacular dividend growth stock, too, boasting 42 consecutive annual increases. Last August, it bolstered its payout by 25%, to 50 cents per share.  Market value: $301.7 million Dividend yield: 3.9% 2019 dividend increase: 25% First Choice Bancorp (FCBP, $25.88) is a Southern California community bank with nine branches and two loan production offices serving Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties. The bank was founded in 2005 and has $1.7 billion in assets. It evolved from being primarily a lender to the Asian-American community to become a more mainstream bank. Since 2014, First Choice has generated 22% yearly loan growth and 21% deposit growth. Assets exploded by 60% in 2018, when it acquired rival Pacific Commerce Bancorp. The merger also enabled FCBP to improve efficiencies via increased scale. Its profits per share have swelled by 28% annually over the past three years, including a 17% improvement during the September quarter. First choice's near-term priorities are deepening its presence in Southern California markets and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It worked toward that latter goal in November, announcing a 25% dividend increase to 25 cents per share - its first payout hike in four years.  Market value: $650.1 million Dividend yield: 1.1% 2019 dividend increase: 25% MGP Ingredients (MGPI, $38.18) is a major supplier of distilled spirits to branded liquor producers, and also produces specialty wheat proteins and starches. Although not a name familiar to many consumers, MGP is a leading supplier of premium bourbon, rye whiskies, distilled gin and vodkas. The company has turned around from a $4.9 million loss in 2013 to a $37.3 million profit in 2019 thanks to MGP's focus on premium liquors, whiskey's rising share of the spirits market, and margin gains from a better product mix. The company's sales of premium alcoholic beverages have grown from 57% of overall sales four years ago to 70% today. In addition to distilled spirits, MGP supplies specialty wheat proteins and starches used in meat substitute products and is well-positioned to benefit from growth in this market to $5.2 billion in 2020. That said, the company's shares recently plunged by almost 28% in a single day recently after it announced considerably weaker preliminary full-year 2019 results than Wall Street was expecting. CEO Gus Griffin said the lackluster guidance was a \"result of us ultimately being unsuccessful in transacting a large portion of the aged whiskey sales we had forecast for the fourth quarter,\" implying the issue wasn't demand, but MGP's ability to execute and capture that demand. As for the dividend: MGP actually doubled its quarterly payout in 2018, from 4 cents per share to 8 cents per share, then followed that up with a 25% hike in 2019, to a dime. Its payout ratio of 17% provides plenty of runway for future dividend growth.  Market value: $19.7 billion Dividend yield: 1.1% 2019 dividend increase: 29% CDW Corp. (CDW, $136.85) is an IT solutions provider to more than 250,000 business, government, education and health-care customers in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. It offers cloud computing, collaboration, security, mobility and data center optimization solutions across 100,000 products sourced from 1,000 business partners. A testimony to just how fractured the IT market is: Despite being a market leader, CDW holds just 5% of the $325 billion opportunity. Growth will come from adding new customers, enhancing capabilities in high-growth solutions areas and expanding service offerings. CDW's sales rose 11% during the first nine months of 2019, fueling a 13% improvement in adjusted earnings per share. The company is guiding for mid-teen EPS gains for the full year, and expects to exceed its internal goal of growing 200 to 300 basis points faster than the overall American IT market. Less trumpeted, but still appreciated, is CDW's flourishing dividend. That payout has skyrocketed by 462% since 2015, including a 29% hike in 2019, to 38 cents per share, following a 40% improvement in 2018. CDW's goal is to maintain a payout ratio of roughly 25%, with the dividend growing as profits do.  Market value: $326.5 billion Dividend yield: 0.5% 2019 dividend increase: 32% Mastercard (MA, $323.65), Visa's chief rival, is another global titan in digital payments. The company's operations span more than 210 countries and territories, and it has processed nearly 79 billion transactions across the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019. Purchase volume over that time grew from $3.5 trillion, from $3.2 trillion in the year-ago nine-month period, and the company boasted 2.6 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards worldwide. Mastercard targets many of the same opportunities that Visa does - its plans for the future include building more into B2B, cross-border B2B and P2P, real-time payments and applications, cyber solutions and data analytics. The company grew revenues by 15% year-over-year during its third quarter, and profits by 21%. Worldwide, its gross dollar volume (GDV) climbed 14% to $1.65 trillion - U.S. growth was 12%, but 16% across the rest of the world. Mastercard has been growing both its dividends and share repurchases over the past few years. As of August 2019, MA shareholders had reaped $6 billion from the company via dividends and buybacks - as much as it had spent across all of 2018. The payout grew by 32% in 2019, to 33 cents per share. Mastercard also cleared the 20% bar with its 2020 hike, announced Jan. 28, to 40 cents per share - a 21% improvement.  Market value: $17.8 billion Dividend yield: 3.5% 2019 dividend increase: 33% Citizens Financial Group (CFG, $40.87) offers retail and commercial banking services through approximately 1,100 branches in 11 states across the Mid-Atlantic, New England and Midwest regions. Headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, the bank had $165.7 billion of assets under management as of the end of 2019. Citizens finished out 2019 with a record fourth quarter for noninterest income, which grew 17% year-over-year on the back of strong mortgage banking, as well as record results from its capital markets, foreign exchange and interest-rate products. For the full year, net income grew by just 2%, to $1.7 billion, though EPS jumped by 8%, to $3.81, thanks to significant share repurchases. The company's \"Citizens Access\" digital platform ended 2019 with deposits of $5.8 billion. Mortgage banking fees surged by 45%, while trust and investment services fees grew by 21%. The company's efficiency initiatives also bore fruit, with the \"Top 5\" program achieving $125 million in pre-tax run-rate benefits in 2019. Its \"top 6\" program is expected to generate between $300 million and $325 million in pre-tax run-rate benefits by the end of 2021. CFG has been among the more aggressive dividend growth stocks of late. It offered up a pair of dividend increases in 2019: an 18.5% increase in January, to 32 cents per share, and a 12.5% bump in July to 36 cents. It's similar to 2018, when Citizens boosted dividends by 22% in January and 23% in July.  Market value: $619.4 million Dividend yield: 1.0% 2019 dividend increase: 33% Independence Holding (IHC, $41.71) underwrites specialty health and disability insurance through its Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American insurance subsidiaries. The company also provides short-term disability and family leave policies for small employers, long-term disability insurance for school districts and municipalities, and specialty health and pet insurance. This company goes through cycles, so revenues and profits tend to ebb and flow. Independence's pre-tax income rose 11% in the September quarter, but EPS declined year-over-year due to reduced tax benefits. The company plans to step up investment in its tech infrastructure to support growth in its pet insurance business and Medicare supplement businesses. The pet insurance market is growing nearly 20% annually; meanwhile, 10,000 new seniors age into the Medicare supplement insurance market every day. Independence also boasts an AA-rated investment portfolio, no debt and substantial free cash flow that totaled $31.7 last year - more than eight times what it paid out in dividends. IHC's semiannual dividend grew by 33% in 2019 - that follows a 50% bump in 2018, and a 67% increase in 2017.  Market value: $7.9 billion Dividend yield: 0.9% 2019 dividend increase: 33% Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR, $181.61) develops and markets high-performance semiconductors used in computer, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer product applications. The company's largest end-market, consumer products, represents nearly one-third of sales; those semiconductors are used in set-top boxes, monitors, home appliances, televisions and other consumer products. Monolithic Power Systems' profits have been steadily but forcefully expanding by about 36% annually over the past five years, fueled by rising demand in its computer, automotive, industrial and communications business lines. The company plans to grow by building market share in the cloud computing, automotive and telecom markets. During this year's September quarter, sales improved by 8% and adjusted EPS rose 3%. MPWR is a relatively new dividend payer, having initiated payouts in 2015. Its dividend growth is new, too - distributions were stuck at 20 cents per share quarterly for the first few years, but jumped to 30 cents per share in 2018, then another 33% last year, to 40 cents.  Market value: $12.2 billion Dividend yield: 4.0% 2019 dividend increase: 39% Leading North American brewer Molson Coors Brewing (TAP, $56.57) has been in a downward trend for roughly three years and lost more than 40% of its value in the process. That slump continued in October, after the company reported September-quarter revenue and earnings misses. The weak results were mainly due to volume declines, which the company hopes to offset with increased efficiencies and stepped-up investing in its better-performing brands. Molson Coors plans to invest more in premium brands such as Blue Moon, Belgian Moon in Canada and Peroni, and expand into new beverage categories such as ciders, wine spritzers and cannabis-infused beverages. The company took one step in that direction in November, announcing a partnership with L.A. Libations, which specializes in emerging non-alcoholic beverages. At the same time, the company plans to save $600 million over the next three years by consolidating its four business units into two. To spark some interest in its lackluster shares, Molson Coors announced its first dividend increase in years - a 39% hike to 57 cents per share. The company expects 2020 to be a transition year marked by flat to low-single-digit growth, but the new higher dividend doesn't appear in danger given a moderate 53% payout ratio.  Market value: $156.5 million Dividend yield: 1.6% 2019 dividend increase: 40% Prudential Bancorp (PBIP, $17.61) is the holding company for Prudential Bank. The Philadelphia-headquartered bank was founded in 1886 and today operates eight branches in its hometown, as well as loan production offices in Huntingdon Valley and Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. The bank has nearly $1.3 billion in assets. PBIP recently reported its second straight year of record financial performance, with assets up 19% year-over-year for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2019, and earnings per share surging by 40%. Some of that growth has come on the back of acquisitions; the 2017 purchase of rival Polonia Bancorp added $285 million (more than 50%) to the bank's asset base. Management attributed strong 2019 results to big gains in interest-earning assets and good expense management, but warned of margin compression due to interest-rate issues. Prudential Bancorp's dividend has improved a few times over the past few years, but it's not a serial raiser. Nonetheless, investors celebrated a 40% hike in the payout, announced in December, to 7 cents per share. The bank also has issued special dividends in three of the past four years, including 2019. Its 45-cent one-time distribution was thrice the 15 cents it paid in 2018.  Market value: $4.9 billion Dividend yield: 2.2% 2019 dividend increase: 41% Best known for its made-to-order burgers, Wendy's (WEN, $21.69) operates more than 6,700 company-owned and franchised fast-food restaurants worldwide and is the world's third largest quick-service restaurant chain. During the September quarter, Wendy's opened 40 new restaurants, bringing the total number of new restaurants opened in 2019 to 111. System-wide sales improved nearly 6% and adjusted EPS rose 12%. A cornerstone of the company's growth strategy is its \"1 More Visit, 1 More Dollar\" initiative, which seeks to increase same-store sales by launching new menu items. Going forward, Wendy's is aiming for 4% to 5% annual system-wide sales growth, high-single-digit free cash flow growth and a dividend payout ratio of roughly 50%. Wendy's has been enhancing the annual sum of its quarterly payout for 10 consecutive years, and it delivered two dividend increases in 2019. First, it announced an 18% upgrade in February, to 10 cents per share, then another 20% hike in October to 12 cents. That amounts to a 41% improvement across the year. That said, its payout ratio is now a hefty 80% of earnings. That doesn't mean Wendy's dividend won't improve in future years, but it does indicate the pace of dividend growth might be muted.  Market value: $1.8 billion Dividend yield: 0.8% 2019 dividend increase: 50% Dillard's (DDS, $71.57) is a department store operating primarily in the Southern and Midwestern U.S. The company operates 259 Dillard's stores and 30 discount centers spanning 29 states. Total store selling space is estimated at 48.9 million square feet. Despite retail's well-known woes over the past few years, Dillard's shares have at least been holding up, notching 24% gains over the past few years - nothing to scream about, but far better than the likes of JCPenney (JCP) and Sears Holdings (SHLDQ). The company's September-quarter results were hardly encouraging, however. While retail margins improved and revenues and profits beat analyst estimates, comparable-store sales (stores open for at least 12 months) were flat and profits per share fell by nearly 19%. Still, free cash flow over the trailing 12 months is 52% better than the year-ago period, reflecting the benefits of Dillard's improved inventory management.  Market value: $68.5 million Dividend yield: 1.1% 2019 dividend increase: 50% First US Bancshares (FUSB, $11.00) is a small but fast-growing commercial lender providing services through 20 branch offices across Alabama, Tennessee and Virginia. The bank also offers consumer lending through its ALC (Acceptance Loan Company) subsidiary, which has 21 offices across 11 states, and reinsurance through its FUSB Reinsurance segment. The bank currently boasts about $772 million in assets. The acquisition of a competitor (The People's Bank) in 2018 added $155 million to First US Bancshares' earnings assets and gave it a presence in the fast-growing Knoxville market. The company has identified 18 cities across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee as targets for branch expansion, and it recently opened new loan production offices in Mobile, Alabama and Chattanooga, Tennessee. The bank's EPS shot 227% higher during the first nine months of 2019 as a result of earnings asset growth and merger-related efficiencies of scale. FUSB's earnings have been something of a roller coaster over the past few half-decade, but they're at least pointed in the right direction now. First US Bancshares had been lifeless on the dividend front, stuck at 2 cents per share quarterly for years. That changed in late November 2019, when the company announced a 50% bump to 3 cents per share.  Market value: $1.3 billion Dividend yield: 3.9% 2019 dividend increase: 51% Medifast (MED, $115.58) manufactures and distributes weight-loss and wellness products and programs, mostly sold under its Optavia brand. The company differentiates its products from other weight-loss brands with clinical studies that have often led to physician recommendations. A network of 32,200 active coaches sold Medifast products during the September quarter; sales averaged $5,715 per coach - down 1% year-over-year. That said, sales exploded by 37% in the quarter, and EPS improved by 16%. Despite this strong quarter, the company significantly lowered its full-year outlook. It lowered its previous guidance, for $730 million to $750 million in sales and $6.75 to $6.95 in EPS, to $700 million to $710 million in sales and $5.80 to $5.90 in EPS. The company expects future growth will come from new products, more coaches, a bigger U.S. footprint and Asia-Pacific expansion. Medifast recently began selling products in Hong Kong and Singapore. Medifast has been churning out impressive dividend growth over the past few years: a 50% increase in 2017, 56% in 2018 and 51% in 2019, to its current payout of $1.13 per share. However, MED's payout ratio is now 77% of this year's expected profits, which means similar dividend growth will really only be possible on the back of significant earnings expansion. The good news there? Analysts are forecasting a 29% jump in the bottom line in 2020.  Market value: $88.3 billion Dividend yield: 2.0% 2019 dividend increase: 56% Financial advisory firm Goldman Sachs (GS, $249.46) was ranked tops in announced and completed mergers-and-acquisitions deals in 2019, according to Dealogic, as well as No. 1 in equity and equity-related offerings. The company derives 40% of revenues from trading, 25% from asset management, 21% from investment banking and 14% from consumer and wealth management. The firm's revenues were flat in 2019, at $36.5 billion, but higher expenses and provision for credit losses weighed on EPS, which declined 17% year-over-year. Its quarterly profits have missed expectations twice in a row, too. That said, Goldman's fourth-quarter revenues were strong, with rebounds in asset management and trading driving a 23% jump in the top line. Goldman Sachs purchased assets being sold at bargain prices by troubled rival Deutsche Bank (DB) in 2019, including an Asian portfolio of equity derivatives valued at $50 billion in September. These asset purchases are helping the bank expand market share. Goldman's 56% payout bump in 2019 came across a pair of dividend increases: A more modest improvement, from 80 cents per share to 85 cents, announced in April, then a 47% burst to $1.25 announced in July. Even after that considerable hike, GS still pays out less than 20% of its profits as dividends.  Market value: $16.0 billion Dividend yield: 0.8% 2019 dividend increase: 56% SS&C Technologies (SSNC, $63.47) provides financial software to more than 18,000 clients worldwide. The company is transitioning from a software seller to a software-enabled service business that can generate higher margins and more recurring revenues. The benefits of this shift were evidenced by the company's 96.4% revenue retention rate in the September quarter and 18% adjusted EPS gains. Operating cash flow surged by 134% during the first nine months of 2019 - a boon that enabled SS&C to pay down debt while continuing to make acquisitions. That's good, because much of its growth - adjusted EPS have improved by 27% annually since its 2010 initial public offering - has come via M&A. The company closed more than $8 billion in purchase transactions in 2018 alone. SS&C is handing more of that cash over to shareholders, too. The company boosted its quarterly dividend by 25% to start 2019, then announced another 25% hike in November, to 12.5 cents per share - a total 56% increase across the year. Like many of these dividend growth stocks, SSNC boasts a still-modest payout ratio of 28%.  Market value: $31.9 billion Dividend yield: 1.1% 2019 dividend increase: 67% Toronto-based Barrick Gold (GOLD, $17.95) is one of the world's largest gold producers. After merging with Randgold Resources last year, the company owns five of the industry's top 10 gold assets and two development-stage assets with the potential to become top 10 gold producers. Barrick's operations are expansive, across 15 countries, but most of its actual production comes from low-risk North American mines. The company's preliminary full-year and fourth-quarter results indicate that Barrick has hit its full-year guidance targets for production. Barrick's preliminary figure for gold production was 5.5 million ounces, versus an expected range of 5.1 million to 5.6 million ounces. Preliminary copper production of 432 million pounds, if it holds, would exceed guidance of 375 million to 430 million pounds. The company is shedding some of the assets it acquired with Randgold. Barrick and its Senegalese joint venture partner recently agreed to sell their 90% stake in a Senegal gold mine, for up to $430 million. This follows the sale of its 50% stake in the Kalgoorlie Super Pit, one of Australia's largest gold mines, for $750 million a month earlier. Barrick Gold was targeting $1.5 billion of assets sales in 2019 and plans to use some of the proceeds to expand its footprint in copper mining. Demand for copper is rising due to the use of this metal in low-carbon technologies. Barrick Gold closed out 2018 by issuing an \"enhanced\" 7-cent-per-share dividend in connection with the Randgold merger (it had paid 3 cents quarterly since the start of 2017). However, its regular payout improved to 4 cents per share starting in 2019, then again to 5 cents later in the year. That represents a 67% improvement from its regular dole from 2018.  Market value: $10.0 billion Dividend yield: 0.2% 2019 dividend increase: 67% Universal Display (OLED, $212.85) develops and commercializes organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials used in smartphones and TVs. Its customers include electronics manufacturers such as Apple (AAPL), LG Display (LPL), BOE Technology, Sharp (SHCAY) and Pioneer. Universal Display holds more than 5,000 patents on its technologies and serves customers from offices in the US, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Ireland. Results have been choppy over the past few years, but generally pointed in the right direction. Revenues have grown roughly 11% per year through the end of 2018; profits have dropped from $1.59 per share to $1.24 per share in that same time frame, but analysts are expecting a $3.10 profit for full-year 2019. New product launches helped Universal Display deliver 71% sales growth and 184% EPS gains during the first nine months of 2019. Universal Display is a perfect example of the massive dividend increases that often come shortly after a company initiates payouts. The company began distributing a 3-cent-per-share dividend in 2017, doubled it in 2018, then hiked the payment another 67% in 2019 to a dime per share. Low 13% payout, the company's minimal debt and big cash reserves provide a wide margin for dividend safety.  Market value: $4.0 billion Dividend yield: 0.5% 2019 dividend increase: 122% UniFirst (UNF, $211.82) supplies workplace uniforms and protective clothing to more than 300,000 customers, and it outfits nearly 2 million workers every business day. Workplace uniforms are a highly concentrated market, with just four companies (including Unifirst) representing more than 40% of industry volume. Growth in the uniform market has been robust at twice the rate of GDP. The company's solid share of a growing uniform market has fueled roughly 5% annual revenue and EPS gains over the past half-decade, and results that have exceeded analyst estimates in nine of the past 10 quarters. Unifirst's EPS rose by almost 14% in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2019, on 7% sales growth. The company is guiding for at least 3% sales growth in fiscal 2020, but lower EPS mostly due to the fiscal year being one week shorter than 2019. Unifirst has ramped up its dividend like a company possessed over the past few years. It announced a tripling of its dividend in 2018, to 11.25 cents per share, then followed that up with a 122% hike announced in October 2019, to 25 cents per share. The outlook for more dividend growth is supported by modest 12% payout, low debt of $45.6 million and cash totaling $356 million.  Market value: $1.0 billion Dividend yield: 4.9% 2019 dividend increase: 186% Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR, $82.50) is a rare bird in the real estate world. This real estate investment trust (REIT) acquires, owns and manages specialized industrial properties that are leased to licensed operators of medical cannabis facilities. The company owns a portfolio of 41 properties across 13 states. Its properties are 100% leased and have average remaining lease terms of 15.5 years. Through the first nine months of 2019, the company had acquired 30 properties across nine states and entered into leasing agreements with 12 new operators. Purchase costs for these properties totaled $106.9 million. To raise capital for more property acquisitions, Innovative Industrial Properties recently issued $134.1 million of exchangeable senior notes and completed a $162.8 million share offering. Diluting shares like that has consequences - the secondary offering triggered an 18% decline in IIPR's shares in July, and the stock lost more than half its value between then and late October. Still, Innovative Industrial Properties has been explosive by any standard, but especially compared to other REITs. Its stock has delivered a total return (price plus dividends) of 379% over the past three years, versus just 29% for the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ). The REIT continues to grow by leaps and bounds, announcing 171% revenue growth during the first nine months of 2019. Adjusted funds from operations (FFO, a measure of profitability for real estate companies) blossomed by 117% on a per-share basis. That has helped shares rebound somewhat off its October lows. IIPR's biggest fireworks in 2019, however, came courtesy of its rapidly climbing payout. The REIT delivered four dividend increases across the year, climbing from 2018's 35 cents per share to $1 per share by 2019's end - a total improvement of 186%.  Market value: $24.6 billion Dividend yield: 1.2% 2019 dividend increase: 450% Boosted semiannual from 16 cents to 32 cents, then boosted to a quarterly 44 cents. Ends up being 450%. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD, $148.79) - a major oil producer in the Permian Basin, America's most prolific shale oil play - delivered a pair of explosive dividend increases in 2019, with an additional twist. The company had doled out a 4-cent-per-share semiannual dividend for years since 2009, when it was forced to cut its payout amid the Great Recession. But that changed in 2018, as PXD quadrupled its dividend, to 16 cents per share. Pioneer then doubled that dole in March 2019, to 32 cents per share, and followed that up by not just raising its regular payout to 44 cents in September, but switching its payout plan from semiannually to quarterly. That projects out to $1.76 per share every year, up from 32 cents last year - a whopping 450% improvement. As for the company itself: It became a pure play in the Permian Basin last year by selling its Eagle Ford shale assets. It sold its remaining Eagle Ford assets in May of last year, for about $475 million, leaving it with roughly 680,000 net acres in the Midland Basin. Pioneer has taken advantage of its improved capital efficiency, $100 million of restructuring-related cost savings, and robust cash to boost shareholder returns through share repurchases and dividend growth. In addition to its generous dividend hikes, the company repurchased $728 million shares during the first nine months of 2019 as part of its $2 billion repurchase plan.

      " Energy companies have drilled so many new wells into the Permian Basin in recent years that it has unleashed a torrent of oil and gas supplies. This gusher has overwhelmed the region's infrastructure, which pushed down prices. Natural gas has been especially hard hit, with prices at two regional hubs falling into negative territory earlier this year. Because of that, many producers chose to flare their natural gas output as opposed to selling it at a loss. At one point, they were burning off enough gas to power every home in the state of Texas.  Pipeline companies like Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI), however, have been racing to solve this problem by building new infrastructure. The company recently brought the much-needed Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (GCX) online slightly ahead of schedule. That project will provide a welcome boost for oil and gas producers in the region as well as its developers. Image source: Getty Images. Kinder Morgan announced that its GCX pipeline began full commercial service this week, which is slightly ahead of the initial view that it would start up in October. As a result, the pipeline will now be able to transport up to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of gas from the Permian to Texas Gulf Coast markets. That's a significant amount of new capacity for a region that currently produces 10 Bcf/d, though a small fraction of the need given that output is on track to top 21 Bcf/d by 2025.  The incremental gas shipping capacity from GCX will provide some relief for producers in the Permian Basin. Large-scale drillers like Apache (NYSE: APA) and Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD), for example, will now be able to ship more of their gas to higher-priced Gulf Coast markets. That will enable them to earn some incremental cash flow. Pioneer's CEO Scott Sheffield made a note of this impact on the company's second-quarter call. He said: Once Gulf Coast Express comes on in the fourth quarter, we will move about 300 million cubic feet a day to the Gulf Coast and price that on a Ship Channel price index. And at that point, virtually all of our gas will be sold outside of the Permian Basin. Even drillers that didn't sign up for space on this pipeline will benefit. That's because it will help ease the region's gas glut, which should boost prices. That will enable them to stop flaring their gas, allowing them to make some money on a commodity they were previously wasting. Image source: Getty Images. The pipeline's investors -- Kinder Morgan, DCP Midstream (NYSE: DCP), Targa Resources (NYSE: TRGP), and Apache's midstream arm Altus Midstream (NASDAQ: ALTM) -- will also benefit from the project's completion. They'll collect a share of the steady fees this system produces from the long-term contracts backing the project. Among the biggest beneficiaries will be Altus Midstream. The company currently expects to generate between $70 million and $85 million of adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) this year. However, after only producing $16.3 million of adjusted EBITDA during the first half, this forecast implies that Altus will experience a significant earnings jump in the back half of the year. That's due in large part to the completion of GCX.  DCP Midstream and Targa Resources, meanwhile, will enjoy an additional boost in their gas gathering and processing (G&P) operations. These companies buy raw gas directly from producers that they then process and sell to end users. GCX will not only boost regional gas prices but also enable them to get more of this gas to higher-priced Gulf Coast markets, which should enhance the profitability of their G&P operations. Targa Resources' CEO Job Bob Perkins pointed out this positive impact on his company's second-quarter call. That's why his company is \"greatly looking forward to GCX coming online, and we will see higher Waha prices (the Permian's gas hub), which will benefit us on the equity side of our volumes.\" The completion of the GCX pipeline will provide some much-needed relief to producers in the Permian. It will not only enable them to ship more gas to higher-priced Gulf Coast markets, but it will also help boost depressed regional prices. Meanwhile, it will be a boon to the pipelines' investors, too. They'll enjoy its steady cash flow and the impact higher prices will have on their gathering and processing operations. GCX is just one of many new Permian pipelines on the way. Kinder Morgan expects to finish its Permian Highway pipeline next year, while another developer recently approved the Whistler Pipeline. Meanwhile, Kinder Morgan also has Permian Pass in development. Given this large slate of new pipelines, it seems like the Permian's gas infrastructure problems are a thing of the past.  10 stocks we like better than ApacheWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Everyone knows that Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) makes trucks, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) makes electric vehicles. But Rivian Automotive? What the heck is that? By the time 2020 is out, I suspect absolutely no one will be asking this question. If you haven't heard of Rivian Automotive yet, here's a quick rundown. Image source: Rivian Automotive. Based in Plymouth, Michigan, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence Rivian Automotive set up shop back in 2009 (although we didn't start hearing a lot about it until just last year). The company hasn't begun operations yet, really, but plans to begin selling its first two electric trucks, the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, in late 2020. Kelley Blue Book advises that both models will seat at least five passengers, with the R1S having an optional three-row, seven-passenger configuration. As all-electric vehicles, they will not have a gas engine -- but may not need one to allay consumers' range anxiety, because both vehicles will be rated for between 300 and 410 miles fully charged.   Because they're trucks, they'll boast significant towing capacity -- 11,000 pounds for the R1T and 7,700 pounds for the R1S. And because they're electric, they'll be able to go really fast when not towing a boat or camper -- accelerating from 0 to 60 in as little as three seconds. Neither truck will be cheap. Rivian expects to price the R1T at $69,000 to start, and the R1S at $72,500, both prices before state and federal tax credits. Now admittedly, none of this information will make much difference to consumers (or investors) if Rivian goes bust, or fails to produce the products it's promised. But recent financing rounds suggest that Rivian will in fact have the cash it needs to go the distance. Last year, for example, Rivian attracted a $700 million investment from a consortium led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which later awarded Rivian a contract to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans specially designed for Amazon's use. (Deliveries will begin in 2020 or 2021, and continue through 2024).   In swift succession, Rivian won a further $500 million investment from a company you'd think would consider it a rival -- Ford -- and $350 million from privately held Cox Automotive. Those investments alone probably would have been enough to make Rivian a viable contender to Tesla, which has an SUV of its own on the market already (Model X), and announced an electric pickup truck offering in November (Cybertruck). But in the waning days of December, Rivian won an even bigger investment -- more money than Ford and Amazon ponied up, combined. On Monday, December 23, Rivian announced it had secured a $1.3 billion investment from \"funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.\" With that money in hand, Rivian ended the year with nearly $3 billion in new funding. Given that the company already has a production plant to build in (Mitsubishi's old plant in Normal, Illinois), $3 billion should be just enough cash to develop the three closely related truck/van models revealed so far. According to autoblog.com, the average cost to develop new cars is about $1 billion per model.   Of course, the question still remains: Will Rivian's trucks sell? According to Wall Street Journal auto reporter Dan Neil, \"we are living through the S-curve of EV adoption,\" and 2020 could very well become the year of the electric \"car.\" That being said, there are going to be a lot of electric cars coming to market this year to choose from, with more than a dozen new models coming on line to compete with existing fare such as Tesla's Models S, 3, and X and Nissan's Leaf.   Although it's hard to keep track of all the moving parts, WSJ alone highlights Volvo's XC40 Recharge, Ford's Mustang Mach-E, and Mini's Mini Cooper SE as viable contenders in addition to Tesla's and Nissan's wares. At starting prices ranging from $60,500 (Ford) to just $30,750 (Mini), each of these new rivals underprices Rivian's offering.   One thing Rivian has got, however, that everyone else has not: Last week, Rivian released a video demonstrating its new \"tank turn\" feature that will be available for both the R1T and R1S. Like a modern main battle tank, the truck's four electric motors can spin in different directions, enabling the truck to literally turn on a dime -- spinning itself around a fixed point.   Probably thought up as a way to market the truck to off-roaders initially, this feature would also make Rivian's truck incredibly maneuverable in tight spaces, such as might be encountered on construction sites, in crowded driveways, and parking garages -- the latter perhaps a valuable selling point to suburban shoppers. Combined with the right software, I suspect Rivian's tank-turn feature will also make parallel parking in even the tightest spaces a breeze. Long story short, yes, this truck will sell. Now, all Rivian needs to do is build it.  10 stocks we like better than WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

      " Investing in a group of quality growth stocks and sticking with them for decades can lead to life-changing wealth. An investment of just $100 per month at an annualized return of 12% over 50 years can grow to $3.9 million.  Three stocks that can help you achieve those returns are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here's why these stocks should remain compounding machines for the next 50 years. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet's Google is still benefiting from the shift of ad spending moving online. Its range of products and platforms, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, and Gmail, each have over one billion users. That's attractive to advertisers, and it's why Google is the No. 3 most valuable brand in the world, according to Brand Finance.  However, over the next 50 years, Alphabet will likely generate significant amounts of revenue from other businesses. The one analysts are watching heading into 2020 is Google Cloud. Google's \"other revenue\" that includes Google Cloud, Google Play, Google Home, and other hardware products has been Alphabet's fastest-growing segment in the last few years, and it may reach 20% of the company's total revenue in 2020.  There are not many companies as forward-thinking as Alphabet that have the resources to invest billions in new growth avenues. The company considers its investments in moonshot opportunities, or \"other bets,\" as vital to its future success. These other bets include potential world-changers, such as self-driving cars with Waymo, or growth opportunities in life sciences with Verily.  Don't let Alphabet's $992 billion market cap make you think the stock has already run its course. The company has more than doubled its revenue and earnings over the last five years, and given its forward-thinking corporate culture, Alphabet should continue to grow for many years. Moving one spot below Google on Brand Finance's most valuable brand list is Microsoft, at No. 4. The software giant has been making essential tools for people to get stuff done for decades. Microsoft has over 900 million Windows 10 users. Under CEO Sadya Nadella, the company has spread its reach well beyond the PC to mobile devices and the cloud. Microsoft has the brand recognition, network effect advantage, and resources to continue winning in the markets it serves. Its Office software is still in high demand after all these years. Even though Apple has 1.4 billion users of its devices, the familiarity people have with Apple's software hasn't dethroned Microsoft's Word and Excel. Office commercial products, including 365 subscriptions, have been growing fast, up 25% year over year in the most recent quarter.  Also, businesses are continuing to use cloud-based tools to handle IT services. The infrastructure-as-a-service cloud market is expected to grow three times faster than traditional IT services through 2022, according to Gartner. Microsoft Azure has tremendous momentum in this space, with revenue surging 59% year over year in the last quarter.  Microsoft has proven it can adapt its basic software services to the cloud and develop new cloud-based platforms for businesses, such as Dynamics 365 and Azure. The ability to adapt to changing environments in technology gives me confidence that the company will still be around in 50 years. It offers good growth prospects, high margins, and a growing stream of dividends. Owning the stock seems like a no-brainer for the 21st century. Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Tesla is not short of investor attention. The stock has experienced a meteoric rise since its initial public offering in 2010, but the sky truly is the limit for Elon Musk's company. Some on Wall Street are debating whether it's time to sell the stock after the share price more than doubled off of its lows last year. But I think long-term investors should stay the course, and if you don't already own shares, you should consider starting a small position. Tesla is at the center of a secular trend sweeping the world, as alternative forms of energy are increasingly in demand for everything from how homes are built to what fuels our cars. Tesla is known for its Model S, Model X, and Model 3 electric vehicles, but it defines its mission as helping the world accelerate to sustainable energy through various energy products, including solar electricity. The company has installed thousands of solar products for consumers since 2006, and last year, it released Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.  You can't underestimate a visionary leader like Musk, who has demonstrated a great talent for seeing an opportunity and starting a business to capture it. As Tesla approaches a $100 billion market cap, the company still has a tiny share of the nearly 100 million vehicles shipped in the industry every year. There were about 367,500 Tesla vehicles delivered in 2019, for an increase of 50% year over year. That growth is thanks to the Model 3, which went into production in 2017 and comes at a much more affordable price for the masses.  However, Musk believes the upcoming Model Y will outsell the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined. As Tesla releases more models, builds Gigafactories around the world, increases scale, and brings prices down for these cars, it's inevitable the company will hit the one-million delivery mark at some point. There is enormous upside for the Tesla brand over the next 50 years. All three stocks are already large caps, but each could keep heading higher from here. Consider that Coca-Cola started in 1886, but the stock is still increasing in value for shareholders. Walt Disney was started in 1923, but the stock is up 355% over the last 10 years. Great growth stocks continue to find ways to deliver returns for shareholders, and I believe Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla will be no different.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      " After settling with a Federal investigation in 2013, Wall Street trader Steven Cohen restarted his hedge fund operations under a new name, Point72 Asset Management, and with a strict series of internal reforms to toe the line with regulators. Cohen remained in the top spot, and brought in new management to help him steer the company. His success has been impressive. The self-made man from Great Neck, New York has built Point72 into a giant of the hedge fund industry, with over $75 billion in total assets under management. That figure includes more than $19 billion worth of stock holdings, reported quarterly on the 13F forms, which draw the attention of investors everywhere. What’s drawn our attention are three holdings that Cohen boosted into the $85 to $99 million range. The large purchases caught our eye, and we ran the stocks through the TipRanks Stock Screener – all three have a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating and over 20% upside potential. That alone would be enough to attract the attention of a major fund, but we’ve taken a deeper dive to find out what else makes these stocks so compelling. First on the list is a Texas oil company. Pioneer operates in the Permian Basin of West Texas, one of the world’s largest oilfields, and has over 1 billion proven barrels of recoverable oil equivalent. The breakdown in the company’s reserves is 53% oil, and the rest split evenly between natural gas and usable natural gas liquids. In production terms, Pioneer put out 319 thousand barrels per day in 2018. Falling fuel prices have hurt PXD in recent months, despite solid growth in production. In the Q3 report, the company detailed a 9% year-over-year production gain, to 351 barrels per day. At the same time, revenues slipped 6%, to $2.33 billion, on lower oil and natural gas prices. Earnings, while down year-over-year, beat the forecast and came in at $1.99 per share. The earnings result was considered a minor win, as it allows the company to sustain both its modest quarterly dividend of 22 cents per share and its high rate of free cash flow. Looking ahead, Pioneer expects higher production in Q4, from new wells and gas processing plants that came online this year, and full-year cash flow of $3.4 billion, more than enough to fully fund all planned capital expenditures. So, in PXD, we have an oil company with valuable assets in a necessary industry, with a clear path to maintaining both output and extraction infrastructure improvement. These are attributes which easily explain Point72’s purchase of 686,750 shares in PXD. The fund’s purchase brings its total holding in Pioneer to 696,668 shares, worth $89.06 million as of the close of trading Friday. Wall Street’s analysts would agree with Steven Cohen’s decision to purchase PXD. Writing from Susquehanna, Biju Perincheril sums up the company’s recent performance: “PXD had a solid quarter, highlighted by a modest oil/total production beat … on much lower capital spending. PXD continues to be one of our top ideas given a combination of free cash flow capacity, production growth, and inventory depth.” His Buy rating comes with a $183 price target, implying room for 43% growth to the upside. (To watch Perincheril’s track record, click here) RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold is also bullish on PXD, and writes that the company has plenty of potential: “PXD's production growth profile, balance sheet, and free cash flow generation are best-in-class and differentiate vs. peers. We expect PXD shares to outperform because of the good balance sheet and upside opportunity in its portfolio. The company has one of the largest and most contiguous acreage positions in the core of the Midland Basin (Permian).” Hanold set a $180 price target with his Buy rating, indicating confidence in a 41% upside for the stock. (To watch Hanold’s track record, click here) Pioneer maintains a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 10 recent ratings. These include 8 Buys and 2 Holds, giving a 4 to 1 advantage to the bulls. Share are trading at $127.84, so the $169 average price target suggests room for about 30% upside. (See PXD stock analysis on TipRanks) Like Pioneer, Restaurant Brands was formed in 2014. QSR is the result of a merger between Burger King, which needs no introduction, and Tim Horton’s, Canada’s most popular coffee shop and restaurant chain. The company also owns Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. QSR is the world’s fifth largest fast food chain, and saw $5.36 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018. Shares in QSR slipped at the end of October, after a mixed Q3 report, but have since regained the loss the stock was mostly flat in November. The disappointing aspect of the Q3 repot was a 1.4% year-over-year same-store sales decline in Tim Horton’s. Burger King and Popeyes both saw growth, with BK gaining on interest in the Impossible Whopper and Popeyes showing a 9.7% same-store sales increase. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.46 billion, just under the $1.47 billion forecast, while the 72-cent EPS met the estimates. The earnings report would not have made much of an impression if Tim Hortons didn’t make up 60% of the company’s overall revenue. The BK and Popeyes segments have been growing consistently since Q3 2018, and the stock has seen overall gains of 25% in 2019, matching the S&P 500 index for the year. Management is upbeat about plans to improve the Tim Hortons brand growth in coming months. QSR’s solid foundation and proven long-term growth convinced Cohen to boost his fund’s holding in this stock. Point72 disclosed a 903,767 share purchase of QSR in Q3. Timing is an important point here, as the fund bought the shares before the Q3 earnings were released, and the fund’s total holding in the stock has since lost $7 million. Point72 still holds $77.87 million in QSR, however; it will be interesting to see what the firm discloses on its next 13F. Analysts were cautious after the Q3 report, but still willing to rate the stock a Buy. Dennis Geiger of UBS wrote, “3Q call commentary focused on Tim Hortons (TH) comp weakness and plans to improve performance, while highlighting sustainability of Burger King and Popeyes strength… Strategic growth plans should support better results, but over time, and we believe many investors are likely to view a meaningful turnaround as a show-me story…” Geiger gave the stock a Buy rating and an $86 price target, suggesting a 31% upside. (To watch Geiger’s track record, click here) Barclays’ 5-star analyst Jeff Bernstein takes a bit less ambiguously bullish stance. He wrote, after investor meetings with company management, “QSR is a pure-play global franchisor of three powerful brands, with long-term global growth potential, led by international unit expansion. Otherwise, a ~100% franchise mix and elevated leverage supports a return of cash. A combination of global diversification, well-managed cost structure, and future M&A potential leaves us bullishly inclined.” Bernstein’s Buy rating comes with an $80 upside, showing room for a 22% upside. (To watch Bernstein’s track record, click here) QSR’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on an impressive 11 Buys, indicating confidence in the stock. Only two analysts rated it a hold, and even they see an upside to the stock. The average price target of $79 implies a 22% upside potential from the current share price of $65. (See QSR stock analysis on TipRanks) Our final stock on this list is another food service company. US Foods is a major distributor in the industry, providing well over 300,000 branded products to over a quarter million customers nationwide. The company’s clientele includes restaurants, healthcare facilities, hotels, schools, and government institutions. Feeding people is another necessity-driven business niche, and US Foods sees over $25 billion in annual revenue. Like QSR above, USFD has gained 25% this year. US Foods flat-out beat the Q3 earnings estimates, showing 65 cents in EPS and $6.53 billion revenue. The year-ago numbers were 55 cents and $6.15 billion – so this most recent quarter was sharp annual gain. The revenue and earnings gains fully justify Point72’s decision in Q2 to buy up more than 854,000 shares of the stock, bringing the fund’s total holding to 2,423,762 shares, worth $96.39 million. It was a 55% increase in Cohen’s holding of the stock. Evaluating US Foods for Wells Fargo earlier this month, 4-star analyst Edward Kelly laid out a strong investment thesis: “USFD, which is the No. 2 player in the consolidating food service industry, represents an attractive investment option, in our view. The company has hit the ground running since its May 2016 IPO, generating strong earnings growth and ramping up M&A, while making progress in deleveraging the balance sheet. Though USFD has struggled to execute more recently as operating headwinds in the industry have accelerated, we continue to believe the company's strategy overall is sound.” Kelly reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, while his $54 price target indicates an upside of 36%. (To watch Kelly’s track record, click here) Jefferies analyst Christopher Mandeville is also bullish on USFD, seeing the stock as well-positioned to survive an economic downturn. He writes, “We believe USFD’s diverse customer mix and greater exposure to Healthcare/Gov’t/Education vs. peers (~25% vs. ~17% SYY and ~13% PFGC) provide relative insulation in the event of a downturn given this segment’s long-term contracts and more consistent purchasing habits.” Mandeville sees a 23% upside to the stock, indicated by his Buy rating and $49 price target. (To watch Mandeville’s track record, click here.) US Foods has had fewer analyst reviews in the last three months than the other stocks on this list, but it still has 5 Buys opposed to just 1 Hold – giving it a consensus rating of Strong Buy. Shares were trading for $39.77 at Friday’s close, and the $48.83 price target suggests an upside of 22%.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments?

      " Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are rising again on Wednesday, extending an extraordinary climb for the stock recently. Including the stock's intraday 6.4% gain as of 11:15 a.m. EST on Wednesday, shares are up more than 140% over the past four months. The stock's sharp gain on Wednesday follows yet another analyst's decision to increase his 12-month price target for the electric-car maker's stock ahead of earnings on Jan. 29. Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors on Wednesday that he believes the company's fourth-quarter earnings and its guidance for vehicle deliveries will not disappoint investors when Tesla reports results later this month. He believes there's robust demand for vehicles in China and Europe. Further, he is particularly bullish on the company's opportunity in China following the start of production at the company's Shanghai factory earlier this year. The opportunity for Tesla in the China market is worth $100 to $300 per share, Ives estimates. The analyst boosted his price target for the stock to $550 -- up from a $370 price target previously. The analyst has a neutral rating on the stock. In addition to reporting its financial results for its fourth quarter on Jan. 29, Tesla will also likely provide guidance for vehicle deliveries in 2020. The automaker saw deliveries rise 50% year over year in 2019, and investors are expecting more sharp growth this year.

The NYSE Energy index was off about 1.3% this afternoon while the shares of energy companies in the S&P 500 also were down over 1.2% as a group. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled $3.09 lower at $60.44 per barrel, sinking almost 5%, while the global benchmark Brent crude contract declined $2.60 to $65.67 per barrel. Natural gas futures fell 2 cents to $2.14 per 1 million BTU. In industry news: US commercial crude oil inventories rose for the first time in four weeks, also weighing on commodity prices, with the Energy Information Administration Wednesday reporting a 1.2 million barrel increase during the seven days ended Jan. 3. That compares with a 3.7 million-barrel decline expected by industry experts polled by S&P Global Platts and the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reportedly saying supplies fell 5.95 million barrels last week. Among energy stocks moving on news: (+) Consol Energy (CEIX) bottomed out this afternoon, dropping 6.6% in late trade. The thermal coal miner Wednesday said it acquired a 25% equity stake in a West Virginia-based manufacturer of carbon foam products, with the $3.5 million deal marking its first investment in the coal-to-products space. Consol also agreed to provide CFOAM Ltd with a $1.1 million term-loan facility for working capital and acquired a $400,000ll first-lien note from an existing creditor.

(-) NexTier Oilfield Solutions (NEX) fell nearly 6%.

(OXY) and Western Midstream Partners LP (WES) announced the execution of several agreements that enable WES to operate as an independent midstream company. The executed agreements include amendments to the limited partnership agreement that significantly expand unitholders' rights, including the right to remove and replace Occidental as the general partner. The amendments included the transfer of the WES corporate officers' employment from Occidental to the Partnership. Occidental said it will no longer consolidate WES's statement of operations, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.  Occidental Petroleum, in an update on its execution of key strategic and financial initiatives following the close of its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, said it plans to continue its operational relationship with WES and expects to maintain a significant economic interest in WES, which Occidental will reduce to below 50% during 2020. Occidental noted that it will provide limited administrative services to WES for up to two years. Occidental said it continues to make progress towards meeting its $15 billion divestiture target, with the recently announced sale of $565 million of Houston and Woodlands real estate assets to the Howard Hughes Corporation. Western Midstream Partners expects 2020 Adjusted EBITDA between $1.875 billion and $1.975 billion and 2020 total capital expenditures between $875 million and $950 million.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

After a rough last five years of revamping its portfolio in an effort to adjust to the new reality of $50 to $70 oil, will Exxon be able to turn it around or will the next five years bring similar results?  XOM data by YCharts On paper, Exxon\\'s stock looks pretty attractive. A\\xa0price-to-earnings ratio of 20 and a 5 percent dividend yield place Exxon among both value stocks and dividend stocks, but the company is in growth mode, too. Image Source: Getty Images. In March, ExxonMobil announced its plans to \"accelerate Permian output to 1 million barrels per day by 2024.\" The Permian Basin is the nation\\'s hottest shale play, producing nearly 5 million barrels per day, which is more than a third of total U.S. output and nearly half of U.S. onshore production. Exxon\\'s announcement included the following takeaways: Exxon\\'s quest comes at a steep cost. The energy stock was able to have such a massive increase in 2018 Permian production thanks to a $6.6 billion purchase of acreage in 2017. Since then, Exxon has continued to expand its Permian operations, and according to Argus Media, which tracks global energy business, \"unconventional output rose by 72% from a year earlier to 293,000 BOE/D [barrels of oil equivalent per day] in the third quarter of 2019.\" Meanwhile, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is on track to raise its Permian output to 900,000 BOE/D by 2023.\\xa0 Aside from its Permian focus, ExxonMobil\\'s 45% stake in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana is another multi-billion dollar investment. ExxonMobil expects the Stabroek Block to produce 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025, bolstered by up to 120,000 barrels of production from the Liza Phase 1 development starting in 2020.\\xa0ExxonMobil began producing oil from its Liza Destiny floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) in December.\\xa0 In addition to Guyana, Exxon is making multi-billion dollar investments in the growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that 50 countries will be importing LNG by 2025, up from 10 at the start of the century.Exxon is the operator of the $19 billion Papa New Guinea LNG Project, the operations of which have the capacity to produce over 8 million tonnes of LNG annually.\\xa0In terms of other LNG projects, Exxon is ramping up investment in the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique. Recently announced in October 2019, the company plans to invest more than $500 million in the initial construction phase of the project which now has a capacity of over 15 million tonnes of LNG annually.\\xa0 Exxon has also made bids for the \"pre-salt\" offshore blocks off the coast of Brazil, one of the largest discoveries over the past few decades. For the time being, uncertainty surrounds Exxon\\'s involvement in these offshore blocks after the November 2019 asset auction\\xa0went bust.\\xa0 There\\'s been a running theme for the large integrated oil and gas company:\\xa0Divest away from stodgy, long-term payoff plays and into quick returns now available in the shale basins throughout the United States. For Exxon, the divestments are fairly extreme,\\xa0totaling $4.8 billion against $8.7 billion in earnings, and capital expenditures of $22.7 billion as of the nine months ended Sept. 30.\\xa0 Exxon operates a system from the wellhead to your car in an effort to balance the risks associated with just exploring for and producing hydrocarbons or solely refining them. The upstream side of oil and gas is typically termed a commodity business, whereas the downstream side is a margin game based on the lowest input cost for a barrel of oil and the highest output of gasoline and distillates. In early September 2019, the number of onshore operating drilling rigs in the United States\\xa0fell below 900 for the first time since 2017. Today, the rig count is 800, more or less. The Baker Hughes Rig Count acts as a yardstick for onshore drilling contractors, which Exxon hires to drill new wells. Despite a trend of fewer rigs, Exxon has 55 operational rigs in the Permian Basin as of the third quarter of 2019, up from 51 in the second quarter and 46 in the first quarter.\\xa0But that\\'s just the upstream side. In addition to its rising upstream portfolio, Exxon has the\\xa0second-largest refining capacity\\xa0in the world. When crude prices are down, Exxon\\'s refinery margins improve since low-priced Permian oil can feed cheaply and efficiently into Exxon\\'s vast downstream refining infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. In terms of downstream growth, Exxon is currently developing 18 refining and petrochemical facilities. Next year, ExxonMobil will celebrate the 150-year anniversary of its predecessor, Standard Oil. In five years, Exxon plans to become one of the largest producers (if not the largest one) out of the Permian Basin. On the flip side, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), the world\\'s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, unveiled a 10-year savings and operations plan that reflects tighter spending in an effort to increase investor confidence by rewarding shareholders with strong dividends built upon consistent free cash flow. ConocoPhillips lowered its capital expenditure budget to roughly $7 billion per year through 2029. Total cash flow generation is expected to be $50 billion with a 3% annual output growth based on \"a real West Texas Intermediate price of $50 per barrel.\" \\xa0 In addition to ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) is also cutting spending in an effort to deleverage its balance sheet after its acquisition of Anadarko. Occidental also\\xa0estimated that its capital budget will decrease from $9.0 billion in 2019 to somewhere in the $5.3\\xa0billion to $5.5 billion range in 2020, which is expected to generate production growth of 2% in the year. Tying it all together, ExxonMobil is raising money from divestments to fund Permian Basin expansion projects\\xa0aimed at producing hydrocarbons quickly and at a low cost that it can then feed into its immense refinery network. The company\\'s quick return Permian assets aim to pair nicely with its large offshore projects and focus on LNG. Exxon should be able to make these investments while raising its dividend, as it has done for 37 consecutive years. The company has increased its dividend by more than 100% in the past 10 years alone. In sum, Exxon and Chevron could be able to pull ahead from independents like ConocoPhillips and Occidental as spending tightens for E&Ps. Although the last five years were tough on Exxon, it seems the company has adjusted well to the new energy environment and could have a bright future.  10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobilWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Since the mid-1950s, Buffett has managed to turn $10,000 in seed investment capital into a personal net worth of more than $89 billion. And keep in mind, this doesn\\'t take into account the tens of billions of dollars Buffett has donated throughout the years. He\\'s also created an incredible amount of value for his shareholders, with Berkshire Hathaway\\'s share price appreciation leading to more than $400 billion in wealth creation for investors over the long run. The big question often is, \"What\\'s Buffett going to buy next?\" Rather than contemplate which of the more than 3,000 publicly traded stocks he could choose to invest in next, let\\'s consider the very real possibility that he could add to one or more of his existing 48 holdings. After all, Berkshire Hathaway does have a record $128.2 billion in cash on hand. This year, I\\'ll be looking for the Oracle of Omaha to use some of his cash pile to add to following three positions. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett at his company\\'s annual shareholder meeting. Image source: The Motley Fool. Call it the biggest surprise of 2019, but Berkshire Hathaway opened a position in Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) for the first time ever. At 537,300 shares currently, Amazon accounts for $1 billion in value of Berkshire\\'s $251.6 billion investment portfolio. Interestingly, it wasn\\'t Buffett himself who dipped his toes into the pond with Amazon. Rather, he credited one of his investment lieutenants for the purchase. These money managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, are also free to make investments using Berkshire\\'s cash on hand.\\xa0 Amazon offers two particular attributes that are liable to attract Buffett, and especially his investment managers. First, there\\'s the company\\'s dominance in e-commerce, which is driven, in part, by its Prime memberships. Aside from offering consumers perks, Prime most importantly keeps users loyal to the brand in a highly competitive retail landscape. According to eMarketer, in June, Amazon was on track to account for 38% of all U.S. e-commerce sales in 2019. Second, there\\'s Amazon\\'s under-the-radar giant, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company\\'s cloud services platform. It was predominantly targeted at small and medium-size businesses, but has become a go-to cloud platform for companies of all sizes. AWS\\' sales growth is currently more than double that of e-commerce, with cloud computing margins also considerably higher than the company\\'s retail operations. Thus, as AWS grows as a percentage of sales, operating income and cash flow for Amazon should soar. You might think Amazon is \"expensive,\" but after being valued at an average of 30 times full-year cash flow over the past five years, the company is now valued at a mere 20 times Wall Street\\'s estimated 2020 cash flow and just over 11 times 2022\\'s estimated cash flow. Amazon is a reasonably inexpensive stock, and I believe that\\'ll lead to Buffett and his team adding to the position in 2020. Image source: Getty Images. Feel free to call this one the \"no duh\" of likely additions in 2020, but expect Warren Buffett to add to his recently opened position in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). During the third quarter, Berkshire acquired nearly 7.5 million shares of Occidental, which are currently worth about $343 million. This represents a relatively small 0.3% stake of Occidental\\'s outstanding share count. The real catalyst here that\\'s likely to get Buffett even more involved is the $10 billion he committed to Occidental Petroleum in April to aid in the acquisition of Anadarko, which had received a competing bid from oil and gas giant Chevron. But the monster financial backing offered by Buffett appears to be one of a few factors that allowed Occidental to be the winner of the buyout sweepstakes. In return for the $10 billion investment, Buffett received preferred stock in Occidental, as well as warrants that would allow for the purchase of as many as 80 million shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $62.50.\\xa0 Following the investment, Occidental\\'s share price proceeded to lose more than 30% of its value by early December, offering Buffett and his team a perceived discount. Buffett has, historically, favored downdrafts in stocks he\\'s purchased, as it gives him and his team an opportunity to build a substantive position in a wonderful company at a fair price. As long as Occidental remains well below where Buffett initially took his stake, I\\'d have to believe the lure of betting on higher long-term oil prices by purchasing more shares of this integrated oil and gas company is very much on the table. Image source: Getty Images. Last, but not least, Buffett has long been a fan of money center banks, and his love affair with banks paid off big time in 2019. When the curtain closed, some of Buffett\\'s favorite bank holdings, such as Bank of America\\xa0and JPMorgan Chase, had registered gains of 41% and 42%, respectively. What\\'s interesting, though, is that perhaps the most conservative and consistent bank of the bunch that Buffett owns, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), \"only\" gained 28%, thereby slightly underperforming the benchmark S&P 500. Throughout the years, Buffett has not been shy about adding to his stake in U.S. Bancorp, and I expect 2020 to be no different. A quick review of the company\\'s most recent operating results shows it\\'s still doing a lot right.

Few will publicly go back at the end of the year and review their forecasts, unless they happened to be spot on, in which case they'll want to trumpet their success. However, I believe in full transparency. That's why I'm reviewing all my stock selections for 2019. Among the ones I called the five top energy stocks to buy last year, there was a mix of winners and losers.  Image source: Getty Images. Natural gas driller\\xa0Antero Resources\\xa0(NYSE: AR) entered 2019 with high expectations. Because it had locked in the price for 100% of its natural gas output, the company expected to generate enough cash to grow its production by between 17% and 20% in 2019. Further, thanks to the monetization of some of its natural gas hedging contracts at the end of 2018 and the planned consolidation of its midstream entities, the company had started returning cash to investors via a $600 million share repurchase program.\\xa0 Antero, however, would go on to produce abysmal results. While the price of both natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) tumbled last year -- which put pressure on Antero's balance sheet -- the main issue weighing on the stock was its burdensome pipeline commitments. The company needs to keep growing its production to\\xa0fill up its pipeline capacity agreements. Because of that, it's burning through cash to increase its output. The company is working to address that issue by\\xa0targeting to sell up to $1 billion in assets in 2020. While Antero believes it will be able to satisfy its pipeline commitments by 2022, investors are losing confidence in the company's ability to create value.\\xa0 Brookfield Infrastructure\\xa0(NYSE: BIP) -- which operates a portfolio of\\xa0energy midstream,\\xa0utility, transportation, and data infrastructure businesses -- delivered exceptional results in 2019. The company benefited from organic growth that came in above the high end of its 6% to 9% target range, as well as acquisitions. The transactions it closed during the year have it on track to exit 2019 with an annualized earnings run rate 17% higher than it was in mid-2018. Meanwhile, it has several more deals in the pipeline, positioning it to\\xa0continue growing at an accelerated pace in 2020. Because of that, Brookfield Infrastructure stock could produce strong returns again this year. Enterprise Products Partners\\xa0(NYSE: EPD) generated a solid return for its investors in 2019. While the master limited partnership (MLP) underperformed the red-hot\\xa0S&P 500, which gained 30% in 2019, it produced much higher total returns than the average energy stock. Fueling its big year was the success of its expansion program. Earnings have risen 14% over the past year, which allowed the\\xa0MLP to\\xa0continue increasing its dividend. Meanwhile, it\\xa0secured several more expansion projects during 2019, which should give it plenty of fuel to keep growing both its cash flow and distribution over the next several years. Because of that, Enterprise Products Partners\\xa0appears poised to continue generating market-beating total returns.\\xa0 Image source: Getty Images. Occidental Petroleum\\xa0(NYSE: OXY) entered 2019 with renewed vigor. The oil and gas producer had just finished up its transformation program, which reduced its oil breakeven level to around $40 a barrel. Because of that, the company was on track to generate lots of cash, since oil started the year around $50 a barrel. However, instead of cashing in on those rising oil prices, Occidental went out a\\xa0paid a significant premium to buy rival Anadarko Petroleum. The move saddled the company with lots of debt and infuriated its investors, which is why its stock slumped. As a result, the company faces an uphill battle in 2020 because it's struggling to sell assets to pay down debt, and has an activist investor pushing it to make changes.\\xa0 TerraForm Power\\xa0(NASDAQ: TERP) produced excellent results in 2019. The\\xa0renewable energy company\\xa0improved the profitability of its legacy assets while continuing to acquire new ones, even as it firmed up its financial foundation. Because of that, TerraForm has lots of momentum entering 2020. Its earnings should continue expanding, which should enable it to increase its dividend once again. Meanwhile, it has plenty of financial flexibility to make more acquisitions, which could provide additional boosts to its cash flow in the coming year. My two worst-performing energy stock picks for 2019 were both oil and gas producers. While commodity price volatility played a role in their underperformance, the biggest factor driving their abysmal stock returns was poor management. In both cases, the companies are pursuing aggressive growth strategies that added heavy debt to their balance sheets, weighing on their share prices. The lesson here is to avoid energy companies being led by management teams who will pursue growth at all costs. On a more positive note, I did well with energy companies that utilize lower-risk business models. Brookfield Infrastructure, Enterprise Products Partners, and TerraForm Power all primarily operate infrastructure that's backed by long-term contracts, which enables them to generate steadier cash flows. Those models have given them the funds to pay growing dividends as well as invest in expanding their portfolios. Because of that, I'm going to focus more of my attention in 2020 on picking energy stocks with similar qualities, since that should improve my odds of selecting winning investments. 10 stocks we like better than Enterprise Products PartnersWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The\\xa0energy\\xa0giant was coming off a transitional year during which it completed its cash-flow breakeven plan. As a result, it only needed oil to average $40 a barrel to support its operations and its high-yielding dividend. With crude starting the year well above that level, Occidental appeared poised to generate lots of excess cash. Indeed, it looked to me like the\\xa0top oil stock to buy heading into 2019. However, instead of sitting back and watching the cash flow in as oil prices rose during the year, Occidental went on the offensive and\\xa0paid a pretty penny to wrestle rival Anadarko Petroleum away from\\xa0Chevron\\xa0(NYSE: CVX). It was a move that infuriated shareholders as it added a substantial amount of debt to Occidental\\'s balance sheet. That weight caused the stock to tumble 33% on the year. In the wake of that slump, the question now is whether Occidental has suffered enough, or if further declines could still be ahead. Image source: Getty Images. Occidental Petroleum laid out a whopping $55 billion for Anadarko, outbidding Chevron by $5 billion. However, in a relatively unusual move for a megamerger, Occidental didn\\'t issue a lot of stock to finance the deal. To do that would have required a shareholder vote that it likely would have lost. Instead, it funded the majority of the transaction with cash -- $31.8 billion overall -- which meant taking on a substantial amount of debt.\\xa0 Occidental aims to pay down that debt burden by selling between $10 billion and $15 billion in assets, and it has made significant progress on that front. \"We are highly confident that the actions we already have in progress will allow us to exceed the upper end of our original $10 [billion] to $15 billion divestiture goal by the middle of 2020,\" said CEO Vicki Hollob in a mid-November update. If everything goes according to plan, Occidental will significantly reduce its balance sheet issues, which should help lift the main weight holding down its stock.\\xa0 In addition to that, oil prices have risen considerably over the past year. Crude ended 2019 up more than 35%, with U.S. benchmark WTI closing above $61 per barrel. If crude oil remains in its current neighborhood, the company should generate significantly more cash flow in the coming year, which it can use to support its dividend as well as further pay off debt.\\xa0 Finally, the main reason Occidental bought Anadarko is that it believed that there were\\xa0significant synergies to be found in combining the two companies\\' operations. Management expects to be able to cut out $3.5 billion of annual expenses by 2021. Progress toward that goal would help prove to skeptical investors that it made the right move.\\xa0 Image source: Getty Images. While Occidental Petroleum still asserts that it can hit the high-end of its asset-sales target, the process has proved more complicated than initially expected. One major piece of the puzzle is the planned sale of Anadarko\\'s African assets to French energy giant\\xa0Total\\xa0(NYSE: TOT). While the companies completed one part of the transaction, Occidental ran into a roadblock with the deal for Anadarko\\'s Algerian assets; that country\\'s national oil company is trying to block the transaction.\\xa0 In addition to that, Occidental wanted to monetize some of its stake in Anadarko\\'s former midstream arm,\\xa0Western Midstream\\xa0(NYSE: WES). However, a\\xa0slump in Western\\'s valuation\\xa0forced Occidental to\\xa0put the process on hold. While Western Midstream\\'s valuation has bounced back a bit, it\\'s still down 29% over the past year. This leaves Occidental with a dilemma -- either sell Western shares at a fire sale price, or fail to hit its assets-sales target. If it\\'s the second option, investors\\' concerns over Occidental\\'s financial profile would likely intensify, which could lead to a further slide in its share price.\\xa0 Also, Occidental\\'s fortunes naturally are tied to the price of oil. While crude was red hot last year, it could give back some of its gains in 2020 as\\xa0new supply enters the market.  Either headwind would be bad for this energy company. But if both occur, it might need to slash its 7.7%-yielding dividend to shore up its finances.\\xa0Add it all up, and more suffering could be ahead for Occidental\\'s shareholders.\\xa0 10 stocks we like better than Occidental PetroleumWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But Rivian Automotive? What the heck is that? By the time 2020 is out, I suspect absolutely no one will be asking this question. If you haven\\'t heard of Rivian Automotive yet, here\\'s a quick rundown. Image source: Rivian Automotive. Based in Plymouth, Michigan, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence Rivian Automotive set up shop back in 2009 (although we didn\\'t start hearing a lot about it until just last year). The company hasn\\'t begun operations yet, really, but plans to begin selling its first two electric trucks, the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, in late 2020. Kelley Blue Book advises that both models will seat at least five passengers, with the R1S having an optional three-row, seven-passenger configuration. As all-electric vehicles, they will not have a gas engine -- but may not need one to allay consumers\\' range anxiety, because both vehicles will be rated for between 300 and 410 miles fully charged. \\xa0 Because they\\'re trucks, they\\'ll boast significant towing capacity -- 11,000 pounds for the R1T and 7,700 pounds for the R1S. And because they\\'re electric, they\\'ll be able to go really fast when not towing a boat or camper -- accelerating from 0 to 60 in as little as three seconds. Neither truck will be cheap. Rivian expects to price the R1T at $69,000 to start, and the R1S at $72,500, both prices before state and federal tax credits. Now admittedly, none of this information will make much difference to consumers (or investors) if Rivian goes bust, or fails to produce the products it\\'s promised. But recent financing rounds suggest that Rivian will in fact have the cash it needs to go the distance. Last year, for example, Rivian attracted a $700 million investment from a consortium led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which later awarded Rivian a contract to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans specially designed for Amazon\\'s use. (Deliveries will begin in 2020 or 2021, and continue through 2024). \\xa0 In swift succession, Rivian won a further $500 million investment from a company you\\'d think would consider it a rival -- Ford -- and $350 million from privately held Cox Automotive. Those investments alone probably would have been enough to make Rivian a viable contender to Tesla, which has an SUV of its own on the market already (Model X), and announced an electric pickup truck offering in November (Cybertruck). But in the waning days of December, Rivian won an even bigger investment -- more money than Ford and Amazon ponied up, combined. On Monday, December 23, Rivian announced it had secured a $1.3 billion investment from \"funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.\" With that money in hand, Rivian ended the year with nearly $3 billion in new funding. Given that the company already has a production plant to build in (Mitsubishi\\'s old plant in Normal, Illinois), $3 billion should be just enough cash to develop the three closely related truck/van models revealed so far. According to autoblog.com, the average cost to develop new cars is about $1 billion per model. \\xa0 Of course, the question still remains: Will Rivian\\'s trucks sell? According to Wall Street Journal auto reporter Dan Neil, \"we are living through the S-curve of EV adoption,\" and 2020 could very well become the year of the electric \"car.\" That being said, there are going to be a lot of electric cars coming to market this year to choose from, with more than a dozen new models coming on line to compete with existing fare such as Tesla\\'s Models S, 3, and X and Nissan\\'s Leaf. \\xa0 Although it\\'s hard to keep track of all the moving parts, WSJ alone highlights Volvo\\'s XC40 Recharge, Ford\\'s Mustang Mach-E, and Mini\\'s Mini Cooper SE as viable contenders in addition to Tesla\\'s and Nissan\\'s wares. At starting prices ranging from $60,500 (Ford) to just $30,750 (Mini), each of these new rivals underprices Rivian\\'s offering. \\xa0 One thing Rivian has got, however, that everyone else has not: Last week, Rivian released a video demonstrating its new \"tank turn\" feature that will be available for both the R1T and R1S. Like a modern main battle tank, the truck\\'s four electric motors can spin in different directions, enabling the truck to literally turn on a dime -- spinning itself around a fixed point. \\xa0 Probably thought up as a way to market the truck to off-roaders initially, this feature would also make Rivian\\'s truck incredibly maneuverable in tight spaces, such as might be encountered on construction sites, in crowded driveways, and parking garages -- the latter perhaps a valuable selling point to suburban shoppers. Combined with the right software, I suspect Rivian\\'s tank-turn feature will also make parallel parking in even the tightest spaces a breeze. Long story short, yes, this truck will sell. Now, all Rivian needs to do is build it.  10 stocks we like better than\\xa0WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

An investment of just $100 per month at an annualized return of 12% over 50 years can grow to $3.9 million.\\xa0 Three stocks that can help you achieve those returns are\\xa0Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here\\'s why these stocks should remain compounding machines for the next 50 years. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet\\'s Google is still benefiting from the shift of ad spending moving online. Its range of products and platforms, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, and Gmail, each have over one billion users.\\xa0That\\'s attractive to advertisers, and it\\'s why Google is the No. 3 most valuable brand in the world, according to Brand Finance.\\xa0 However, over the next 50 years, Alphabet will likely generate significant amounts of revenue from other businesses. The one analysts are watching heading into 2020 is Google Cloud.\\xa0Google\\'s \"other revenue\" that includes Google Cloud, Google Play, Google Home, and other hardware products has been Alphabet\\'s fastest-growing segment in the last few years, and it may reach 20% of the company\\'s total revenue in 2020.\\xa0 There are not many companies as forward-thinking as Alphabet that have the resources to invest billions in new growth avenues. The company considers its investments in moonshot opportunities, or \"other bets,\" as vital to its future success.\\xa0These other bets include potential world-changers, such as self-driving cars with Waymo, or growth opportunities in life sciences with Verily.\\xa0 Don\\'t let Alphabet\\'s $992 billion market cap make you think the stock has already run its course.\\xa0The company has more than doubled its revenue and earnings over the last five years,\\xa0and given its forward-thinking corporate culture, Alphabet should continue to grow for many years. Moving one spot below Google on Brand Finance\\'s most valuable brand list is Microsoft, at No. 4.\\xa0The software giant has been making essential tools for people to get stuff done for decades. Microsoft has over 900 million Windows 10 users.\\xa0Under CEO Sadya Nadella, the company has spread its reach well beyond the PC to mobile devices and the cloud. Microsoft has the brand recognition, network effect advantage, and resources to continue winning in the markets it serves. Its Office software is still in high demand after all these years. Even though Apple\\xa0has 1.4 billion users of its devices,\\xa0the familiarity people have with Apple\\'s software hasn\\'t dethroned Microsoft\\'s Word and Excel. Office commercial products, including 365 subscriptions, have been growing fast, up 25% year over year in the most recent quarter.\\xa0 Also, businesses are continuing to use cloud-based tools to handle IT services. The infrastructure-as-a-service cloud market is expected to grow three times faster than traditional IT services through 2022, according to Gartner.\\xa0Microsoft Azure has tremendous momentum in this space, with revenue surging 59% year over year in the last quarter.\\xa0 Microsoft has proven it can adapt its basic software services to the cloud and develop new cloud-based platforms for businesses, such as Dynamics 365 and Azure.\\xa0The ability to adapt to changing environments in technology gives me confidence that the company will still be around in 50 years. It offers good growth prospects, high margins,\\xa0and a growing stream of dividends. Owning the stock seems like a no-brainer for the 21st\\xa0century. Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Tesla is not short of investor attention. The stock has experienced a meteoric rise since its initial public offering in 2010, but the sky truly is the limit for Elon Musk\\'s company. Some on Wall Street are debating whether it\\'s time to sell the stock after the share price more than doubled off of its lows last year.\\xa0But I think long-term investors should stay the course, and if you don\\'t already own shares, you should consider starting a small position. Tesla is at the center of a secular trend sweeping the world, as alternative forms of energy are increasingly in demand for everything from how homes are built to what fuels our cars. Tesla is known for its Model S, Model X, and Model 3 electric vehicles, but it defines its mission as helping the world accelerate to sustainable energy through various energy products, including solar electricity.\\xa0The company has installed thousands of solar products for consumers since 2006, and last year, it released Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.\\xa0 You can\\'t underestimate a visionary leader like Musk, who has demonstrated a great talent for seeing an opportunity and starting a business to capture it.\\xa0As Tesla approaches a $100 billion market cap,\\xa0the company still has a tiny share of the nearly 100 million vehicles shipped in the industry every year.\\xa0There were about 367,500 Tesla vehicles delivered in 2019, for an increase of 50% year over year.\\xa0That growth is thanks to the Model 3, which went into production in 2017 and comes at a much more affordable price for the masses.\\xa0 However, Musk believes the upcoming Model Y will outsell the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined.\\xa0As Tesla releases more models, builds Gigafactories around the world,\\xa0increases scale, and brings prices down for these cars,\\xa0it\\'s inevitable the company will hit the one-million delivery mark at some point. There is enormous upside for the Tesla brand over the next 50 years. All three stocks are already large caps, but each could keep heading higher from here. Consider that\\xa0Coca-Cola\\xa0started in 1886,\\xa0but the stock is still increasing in value for shareholders.\\xa0Walt Disney\\xa0was started in 1923,\\xa0but the stock is up 355% over the last 10 years. Great growth stocks continue to find ways to deliver returns for shareholders, and I believe Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla will be no different.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Declines werenÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t large Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x94 the S&P 500 closed down just 0.29% Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x94 but major indices finished the session at the lows.   To be sure, a modest intraday decline doesnÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t mean the decade-long bull market is over. All three indices closed Thursday, once again, at new all-time highs, as the easing of tensions in the Middle East brought buyers back into the market. That said, FridayÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s trading adds to the sense that there are some modest concerns at the moment, or at least some risks to watch. Earnings season . Valuations do look potentially stretched after huge 2019 returns. Domestic political developments could impact sentiment as presidential primaries arrive. MondayÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s big stock charts feature three names for which those external considerations should impact trading going forward. All three stocks have managed to find a bottom in the last few months after pulling back Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x94 no surprise in an equity market making new all-time highs. All three charts show that strength can continue if these stocks can dodge some of the same risks that threaten the market as a whole.    Investors bought the dip in UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:), and with good reason. UNH stock has been one of the best performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the past decade. Those who stepped in at early October lows are up nearly 40% since Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x94 but the first of MondayÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s big stock charts highlights a risk that the rally will stall out: Ã¢Â\\x80Â¢ UNH stock still sits modestly below December highs. And the narrowing ascending wedge pattern does present a risk of a reversal, particularly with shares threatening to slip out of that wedge. A downside exit would suggest a decline toward moving averages, with the 50-day providing initial support at $280 and the 200-day back down near $250 at the moment. Ã¢Â\\x80Â¢ Fundamentally, UnitedHealth stock still looks attractive at 18x forward earnings. The  likely holds even just off all-time highs. But competitors are eyeing the companyÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s market share. And itÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s certainly fair to wonder if the looming U.S. presidential election will drive volatility in UNH stock in 2020 Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x94 or at least lead some investors to the sidelines until political clarity emerges. Ã¢Â\\x80Â¢ An investorÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s view of UNH, then, might well be driven by her view of the market as a whole. Political risk obviously isnÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t limited to UnitedHealth stock: elections could hover over stocks for the next ten months. On the other hand, this has been a market where investors have been rewarded for focusing on quality over valuation and for sticking with winners. If that trend holds, UNHÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s rally might have another leg ahead.    The second of our big stock charts, railroad operator CSX Corporation (NYSE:), also shows a bottom. And there is a technical case for the uptrend to continue: Ã¢Â\\x80Â¢ CSX stock has exited a triangle pattern to the upside, and sits nicely in the center of an uptrend that has held since late August. Moving averages look like they can provide near-term support. And a bullish golden cross could loom in the coming weeks: if CSX can keep rallying, the 50-day moving average should clear the 200-day.   Ã¢Â\\x80Â¢ Market factors will matter. Railroads are notoriously sensitive to the macroeconomic climate. If the market as a whole sells off, CSX stock likely will as well. Ã¢Â\\x80Â¢ As a result, CSX stock looks like an intriguing pick for macro bulls. The near-term technical outlook is positive. Valuation is attractive if external factors cooperate. And yet shares actually trade below where they did sixteen months ago. ThereÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s a nice case that CSX stock should be able to catch up with the rest of the market, and even outperform other big railroad stocks like Union Pacific (NYSE:) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:).    It does look like the third of MondayÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s big stock charts has played out. For Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:), trading going forward will depend on whether the stock can break through resistance: Ã¢Â\\x80Â¢ OXY stock already has made its move. Shares have reversed out of a narrowing descending wedge and cleared moving averages. To be sure, thereÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s still a lot of ground left to cover: Occidental stock touched a 14-year low last month. Ã¢Â\\x80Â¢ The catalyst to the downside has been OxyÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum. Occidental,  Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:,NYSE:BRK.B),  with Chevron Corporation (NYSE:). But crude oil prices wound up falling sharply, and the leverage used to fund the deal amplified the impact of those declines on OXY stock. Ã¢Â\\x80Â¢ That history, however, makes OXY somewhat interesting at the moment. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices actually have recovered most of their losses Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x94 but the same isnÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t true for the stock. ItÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s too simple to argue that OXY should return to $60+, but there is a case that shares should retrace more of the losses than they have so far. With a key level around $47 and the 200-day moving average not far above current levels, that case needs to be right. If it is, OXY can bust through resistance and continue its breakout. If not, the third of MondayÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s big stock charts may show yet another reversal in the not-too-distant future. As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

The stock's sharp gain on Wednesday follows yet another analyst's decision to increase his 12-month price target for the electric-car maker's stock ahead of earnings on Jan. 29. Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors on Wednesday that he believes the company's fourth-quarter earnings and its guidance for vehicle deliveries will not disappoint investors when Tesla reports results later this month. He believes there's robust demand for vehicles in China and Europe. Further, he is particularly bullish on the company's opportunity in China following the start of production at the company's Shanghai factory earlier this year. The opportunity for Tesla in the China market is worth $100 to $300 per share, Ives estimates. The analyst boosted his price target for the stock to $550 -- up from a $370 price target previously. The analyst has a neutral rating on the stock. In addition to reporting its financial results for its fourth quarter on Jan. 29, Tesla will also likely provide guidance for vehicle deliveries in 2020. The automaker saw deliveries rise 50% year over year in 2019, and investors are expecting more sharp growth this year.

Even though the \"Oracle of Omaha\" only managed to keep pace with the return of the benchmark S&P 500 over the past decade, there\\'s little denying how impressive his investing prowess has been over the long run. After all, he has created more than $400 billion in wealth for his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. One of the ways Buffett builds wealth for himself and his shareholders is by investing a significant amount of Berkshire\\'s money. Right now, Berkshire owns 48 securities with a market value of $251 billion. Suffice it to say that when Buffett buys or sells a stock, Wall Street and investors pay close attention. In 2019, Buffett wound up opening a position in or adding to nine companies. But the Oracle of Omaha also sold shares in or completely sold out of nine stocks. Here are the companies Buffett lightened the load on last year. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett at his company\\'s annual shareholder meeting. Image source: The Motley Fool. No, your eyes aren\\'t deceiving you -- Berkshire Hathaway did sell 750,000 shares of tech kingpin Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the third quarter. Keep in mind, though, that Buffett and his team still hold 248.8 million shares and that at nearly $75 billion in value, Apple is Berkshire\\'s largest position by a mile! It\\'s unclear why 750,000 shares were disposed of, but it seems pretty clear that Buffett wasn\\'t behind the sale. Remember that while Buffett is in control of the lion\\'s share of Berkshire\\'s investment portfolio, a small number of his trusted team are also free to make investments. Buffett has suggested he has no intention of paring his Apple stake, so this sale likely represents a move by a member of his team and not the Oracle himself. During the third quarter, we also saw Berkshire Hathaway reduce its holdings in satellite radio operator Sirius XM (NASDAQ: SIRI) by 1.64 million shares. This, too, was a very small paring of about 1%, with Berkshire continuing to hold 136.3 million shares, or 3.1% of Sirius XM\\'s outstanding share count. Although Sirius XM\\'s expenses rose considerably in 2019 following the closure of its acquisition of Pandora, Berkshire\\'s modest sale doesn\\'t appear to indicate any change in thinking from Buffett. Sirius XM remains the only game in town when it comes to satellite radio, and it should, in theory, crush its year-over-year comparisons as it realizes synergies from its Pandora acquisition and builds on its subscriber and streaming base. Image source: Wells Fargo. Maybe the biggest eye-opener of 2019 was that Buffett sold a portion of his stake in money center bank Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) in the first and third quarters (according to 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission). In total, Berkshire sold more than 48 million shares of its Wells Fargo stake last year and now holds close to 378.4 million shares. Why sell a position that\\'s been held for more than 30 years? Although the case could be made that Buffett is a bit gun-shy with Wells Fargo following its fake-account scandal in 2016, the reasoning looks to be more tied with Buffett lowering his stake to a more comfortable level. Berkshire began the year owning close to 10% of Wells Fargo\\'s outstanding shares, and Buffett has long preferred to keep his stakes below that key threshold. The selling was even more pronounced with integrated oil and gas giant Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX). Buffett shrank his company\\'s stake in Phillips 66 by more than 6.7 million shares in 2019, representing a 56% haircut. The likeliest reason behind this reduction has to do with Buffett pledging $10 billion to Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) to help facilitate its acquisition of Anadarko. This investment appeared to signal Buffett\\'s view that Occidental is a more attractive oil and gas play than Phillips 66, which has increased more than 200% since Buffett\\'s initial stake in 2012. Energy is not a big portion of Berkshire\\'s portfolio, so it wouldn\\'t be surprising if Buffett were also simply locking in some gains. Image source: IBM. Berkshire Hathaway also completely disposed of its stake in cloud services company Red Hat, albeit this statement comes with an asterisk. That\\'s because IBM (NYSE: IBM) acquired Red Hat in a $34 billion all-cash deal that closed in July. IBM has seen its sales fall precipitously for the better part of six years and is hoping that Red Hat\\'s enterprise-focused suite of cloud products will help reignite top-line growth. Buffett, a previous (and disappointed) owner of IBM stock, was simply happy to take the cash from this deal and walk away. A somewhat regular fixture in Berkshire\\'s sale column in recent years is cable services provider Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR). Berkshire sold shares on a couple of occasions in 2019, ultimately reducing its stake by 1.61 million shares to 5.43 million. Despite the consistent threat of cord-cutting, Charter\\'s stock has been molten hot. Shares have tripled since Buffett took his initial stake in 2014, and the Oracle of Omaha\\'s regular selling looks to be nothing more than modest profit taking to lock in gains. Considering that Charter\\'s top line is growing by a mere 5% annually and the company\\'s forward price-to-earnings ratio is an aggressive 37, I can\\'t exactly blame Buffett for trimming his total. Despite Berkshire owning a stake in four airline stocks, only Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) found itself cruising at a lower altitude in Buffett\\'s portfolio in 2019. However, similar to Apple and Sirius XM, the sale proved to be modest. Buffett reduced his company\\'s stake in Southwest by roughly 1.2 million shares, or about 2%. Buffett became enamored with airlines in 2016, following West Texas Intermediate oil\\'s brief collapse below $30 a barrel. With fuel representing a core expense for airlines, this drop in crude led to a windfall of profits. More specifically, it allowed major airlines to be more price competitive with the bare-bones-ticket airlines. But with the U.S. economy likely in the late innings of its economic expansion and the airline industry having a poor track record during recessions, it wouldn\\'t be surprising to see Buffett further shrink his holdings in Southwest and his other airline stocks in 2020. Image source: Getty Images. Similar to Red Hat, Berkshire \"disposed\" of its longtime stake in building products manufacturer USG Corp. in the second quarter following German-based Knauf\\'s acquisition of USG for $43.50 in cash per share plus a $0.50-per-share special dividend. This worked out to about $7 billion in total market value. The deal ultimately combined two building material giants to create a company with improved operating efficiency and global scale in the drywall business. Last but not least, Buffett sold his \"whopper of a stake\" (note: sarcasm is imminent) of telecom provider Verizon (NYSE: VZ) in the first quarter. That stake tallied 928 shares, with a market value of around $52,000. What\\'s really odd is that Berkshire sold 99.99% of its Verizon stake in the fourth quarter of 2016 (a 15-million-share disposition) but left the remaining 928 shares in the portfolio for more than two additional years. Buffett stopped being a fan of telecoms a while ago, so why Verizon\\'s token stake lasted this long remains a mystery. But perhaps the bigger mystery is, what stocks might Buffett sell in 2020?  10 stocks we like better than Wells FargoWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The average energy stock in the\\xa0S&P 500\\xa0rose only about 5% on the year, which vastly trailed the overall index's 28.9% surge. The\\xa0energy sector's\\xa0underperformance came even though the price of oil rebounded about 35% on the year.\\xa0 That's left several of the sector's top companies trading at relatively attractive valuations, making them great buys right now. Leading the way are\\xa0midstream\\xa0giant\\xa0Energy Transfer\\xa0(NYSE: ET), top-tier\\xa0upstream oil and gas producer\\xa0EOG Resources\\xa0(NYSE: EOG), and leading\\xa0refiner\\xa0Marathon Petroleum\\xa0(NYSE: MPC). Image source: Getty Images. Energy Transfer is one of the\\xa0largest master limited partnerships\\xa0in the energy sector. While big companies usually don't grow very quickly, that's not the case with Energy Transfer, as it was on track to expand its earnings by 16% last year. That trend should continue\\xa0again this year. Because investors highly value growth, companies with strong growth rates tend to trade at premium valuations. However, for whatever reason, investors aren't giving Energy Transfer any credit for its above-average growth profile. Instead, they value the company at less than 9 times its earnings, which is well below its peer-group average of around 11. This low valuation, which has only\\xa0gotten cheaper in the past year, is a big reason Energy Transfer currently yields an eye-popping 9%. That yield, when combined with Energy Transfer's low valuation and growth prospects, gives it the potential to generate significant total returns when investors finally come to their senses. EOG Resources' performance over the past year has been a real head-scratcher. Shares of the oil producer have tumbled about 16% even though crude prices have rebounded sharply. The reason that underperformance doesn't make sense is that EOG Resources can thrive at $50 oil. At that price point, the company can produce enough cash to grow its oil output by more than 10%, as well as fund its dividend with room to spare. That's why it's producing a gusher of excess cash now that crude prices are around $60 a barrel. EOG Resources believes its strategy of drilling low-cost, high-return oil wells that grow both its production and excess cash should make it a\\xa0winner over the long term. Marathon Petroleum also delivered an underwhelming performance last year, as shares slumped 14%. That's leading an activist investor to press the company to make some changes to\\xa0unlock shareholder value. It's already working on some of them, which includes plans to spin off its Speedway\\xa0gas station business\\xa0as a separate publicly traded company later this year. Meanwhile, it's also evaluating options for MPLX, its MLP, which could include spinning off the units it owns to create an independent company. Those moves to refocus its strategy on its core refining business should enable Marathon to take even greater advantage of\\xa0new fuel standards in the shipping sector. That catalyst, when combined with other actions it's taking to increase its refining margin, should help bolster that business. Add that to the potential value-unlocking moves from spinning off affiliated entities, and\\xa0analysts expect Marathon's stock to be a big winner this year. Energy stocks continued to disappoint investors last year, even though oil prices rebounded. That's due in large part to investor sentiment that remains negative despite improving industry fundamentals. Although it will likely take quite some time for investors to change their minds, when they do, this trio could produce significant gains, given their underperformance last year despite all they have going for them. That makes them among the most compelling energy stocks to buy right now. 10 stocks we like better than Marathon PetroleumWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It has almost single-handedly turned the U.S. into an\\xa0energy export juggernaut. While fracking has fueled significant production growth in the country, it hasn't helped boost the stock prices of most\\xa0energy companies. That's because most focused on growing no matter the cost instead of aiming to create value for their shareholders. That approach, however, has started to change in recent years, as many fracking-focused producers are using the process to generate free cash instead of even more production. That potentially sets these companies up to produce strong returns in the coming year. Three that stand out this January are\\xa0EOG Resources\\xa0(NYSE: EOG),\\xa0Devon Energy\\xa0(NYSE: DVN), and\\xa0Diamondback Energy\\xa0(NASDAQ: FANG). Image source: Getty Images. EOG Resources is one of the country's fracking leaders. While the company -- like many of its peers -- initially focused on growing its output as fast as it could, it has shifted its aim toward earning premium returns on the wells it drills. As a result, EOG Resources has become one of the lowest-cost producers in the country.\\xa0 It currently only needs oil to average around $50 a barrel to provide it with enough cash flow to grow its production at a double-digit rate while also\\xa0supporting its fast-growing dividend. Since crude oil is currently in the $60s, it's on track to produce significant free cash flow in the coming year. EOG plans to use that money to pay off debt as it comes due, allowing it to strengthen its already top-notch balance sheet. The company believes that its strategy will enable it to\\xa0produce market-smashing returns over the long haul, making it a top fracking stock to buy this month. Devon Energy has spent the past few years transitioning into a low-cost, U.S-focused oil growth company. It\\xa0completed its transformation last month\\xa0by selling its remaining low-margin gas assets. Now it's on track to start generating lots of excess cash this year. In Devon's estimation, it can fund its current drilling program and dividend as long as oil averages $48 a barrel this year. As such, it's on course to produce about $675 million in free cash this year if oil stays around its current $60-a-barrel level. Devon plans on using all that money to continue buying back stock, which could catapult its shares higher this year. Diamondback Energy has significantly grown its scale over the years by acquiring drillable land in the oil-rich Permian Basin. That has enabled it to drive down costs and improve profitability. This strategy should start paying some real dividends in 2020. In Diamondback's estimation, it can produce enough cash at $45-a-barrel oil to fund its growth-focused drilling program and its dividend. Because of that, it's on track to generate a significant amount of free cash flow in 2020. At $55 a barrel, for example, it can match Devon's level of\\xa0producing $675 million in free cash flow this year, all of which it intends on returning to shareholders via its stock buyback program. With crude currently well above that level, Diamondback is on pace to produce even more cash this year, which it will likely return to investors. That's\\xa0why most analysts believe its stock has the biggest upside ahead in 2020. These three fracking stocks have all worked hard to enable their operations to thrive at lower oil prices. As a result, they're on course to produce a significant amount of free cash flow in the coming years since crude is currently well above their breakeven levels. That sets these companies up to return a gusher of cash to their investors this year via dividends and share buybacks, which could help them produce market-beating total returns. This upside potential makes them the top fracking stocks to buy this month. 10 stocks we like better than Devon EnergyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The sector was once an excellent place for income-seeking investors to get above-average yields. However, when oil prices fell off their triple-digit perch a few years ago, it took many of the sector's dividends down with it. The industry has worked hard since that time to deal with its new reality of lower oil prices by cutting costs. These efforts have been paying dividends. That has allowed producers to begin sending more cash to their investors once again. And that means income-focused investors should start paying closer attention to this sector. Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy (NYSE: WPX) has been working hard over the past few years to reshape its business. The company sold several assets to reduce debt as well as finance its expansion program in the low-cost, oil-rich Permian Basin. Those moves were all part of a strategy to begin returning cash to its investors by 2021.  Last year was a pivotal one for the oil and gas company as it reached its debt reduction target. The company entered 2019 needing oil to average only about $50 a barrel to fund its expansion plan. However, thanks to higher oil prices, additional asset sales, excellent operating results, and a needle-moving acquisition, WPX Energy was able to accelerate its capital return program. It started by authorizing a $400 million share repurchase program in August. It has since initiated a quarterly dividend, which it will begin paying after closing its latest acquisition. While that payout's implied yield of 0.8% might not be all the appealing to income-seeking investors, WPX Energy should have the fuel to grow its dividend at a healthy rate in the coming years, which makes it more attractive.  Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy is joining many of its peers in starting small. However, what these payouts have lacked in size, they've more than made up for with growth. Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), for example, initiated a small dividend last year, which yielded around 0.5%. The company boosted that payout by 50% earlier this year and now yields about 0.9%. With Diamondback on track to generate a gusher of free cash in 2020 if oil remains at its current level, it will probably give its investors another sizable raise next year as well as buy back a big chunk of its stock.  Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD), meanwhile, had been paying its investors a paltry dividend for many years. However, the company started increasing it at a rapid pace in 2018. This year alone, Pioneer doubled its payout in February and then boosted it by another 175% in August. As a result, it has now increased its dividend by an eye-popping 2,100% in the last two years, driving its yield up to 1.2%. Oil giants ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), likewise, have boosted their payouts at impressive rates. ConocoPhillips was one of several oil stocks that slashed its dividend as a result of crashing crude prices a few years ago. However, it has been growing at an accelerated rate in recent years. The company started with a 6% increase in 2016 and followed that up with two more last year -- 7.5% in February and another 7% in December -- before giving its investors a monster 38% raise this October. With that latest increase, ConocoPhillips now yields an above-average 2.7%. EOG Recourses, on the other hand, kept its payout flat during the darkest days of the oil market downturn. It has since restarted its dividend growth engine, giving its investors two raises last year and another 31% increase this year. As a result, it now yields about 1.5%. More high-octane growth, however, is up ahead, given that the company aims to push its yield up to at least the level of the S&P 500, which is around 2%. While most oil stocks don't pay high yields these days, many are growing their payouts at rapid rates. That's noteworthy, considering that dividend growth stocks have historically produced the highest total returns. That's why income investors might want to consider adding a dividend-paying oil stock to their portfolio since they could generate some high-octane total returns in the coming years as they keep increasing their payouts at a fast pace.  10 stocks we like better than ConocoPhillipsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It's not even close. The S&P 500 has rallied 75% over the past five years, while energy stocks, as measured by the Energy Select SPDR ETF, have produced a negative 5% return. On a more positive note, the sector has bounced back a bit this year, rising 7% year to date. Still, that has badly trailed the scorching-hot S&P 500, which is up nearly 30% on the year.  Wall Street analysts, however, expect better things from energy stocks in 2020. Not only are they bullish on the sector overall, but they also see some potentially big winners. Here's a look at the five oil stocks that they believe have the most upside in 2020. Image source: Getty Images. Most analysts are bullish on Permian Basin-focused oil driller Concho Resources (NYSE: CXO). Overall, 79% of those who follow the company have a buy or equivalent rating on its stock, with their consensus 12-month price target coming in at $100.74. With shares recently trading at around $78.75 apiece, analysts see 28% upside. One reason analysts like what's ahead for Concho Resources is that it recently launched a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. With its stock tumbling more than 20% this year due to the poor results of a well spacing test in the second quarter, its buyback could retire about 10% of its outstanding shares. That repurchase program could provide a meaningful lift to Concho's stock in the coming year. Eighty-three percent of the analysts who cover shale giant EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) have a buy or equivalent rating. Even after adding in their less bullish peers, the 12-month consensus price target for the stock is $99.03 per share, which is about 31% above its recent price. What analysts love most about EOG is that it continues to exceed expectations. That was the case during the third quarter, as its oil production beat its guidance while costs came in below projections. That trend should continue in 2020, which is why analysts believe EOG's shares have lots of room to run.  Refining giant Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: MPC) is a favorite among the analyst community. Currently, 89% of those who follow the stock have a buy or equivalent rating, with a 12-month consensus price target of $80.65. That implies 38% upside given that shares recently traded at $58.61 apiece. The main factor driving that optimism is that activist investor Elliott Management is pushing the company to make changes to boost shareholder value. One of those is to spin off its Speedway gas station business into a separate publicly traded company, which Marathon expects to complete by the end of next year. That move to unlock value, as well as others the company intends on making to boost its profitability, could propel its stock higher in 2020. Image source: Getty Images. While not as many analysts are bullish on TechnipFMC (NYSE: FTI) -- roughly 81% rate its stock a buy or equivalent -- those that are believe its shares could soar. That's clear from the 12-month consensus price target of $28.56, which is 43% above its recent trading price. The top reason analysts see so much upside is that TechnipFMC plans to split into two publicly traded companies in 2020. One will focus on providing engineering and construction services to the energy sector, while the other will be a fully integrated technology and services provider. That move has the potential to unlock value for investors as those companies focus on their core areas of expertise.  Analysts adore Permian Basin driller Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG). An eye-popping 97% of those who follow the company rate its stock a buy or something equivalent. Furthermore, their 12-month consensus price target is $124 per share, which is a whopping 46% above its recent price. One thing analysts love about Diamondback is that it's on track to generate a gusher of free cash flow next year. If crude averages $55 a barrel in 2020, the company will produce $675 million in free cash flow. It will haul in even more cash if oil stays near its current price of around $60 a barrel. Diamondback will likely return all that cash to investors via its rapidly rising dividend and share repurchase program. As a result, analysts believe it can generate high-octane returns in 2020.  While the energy sector has underperformed in recent years, analysts see some bright spots that could deliver big gains for investors in the coming year. They see the most upside in these five oil stocks, due in part because most have a noteworthy catalyst that could boost their share prices in 2020. Investors should at least take a closer look at this group, as they could deliver big-time returns over the next 12 months.  10 stocks we like better than Marathon PetroleumWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand.  Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\\n\\n \\nClick here to find out which 9 other ETFs had notable inflows »\\n The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

But Rivian Automotive? What the heck is that? By the time 2020 is out, I suspect absolutely no one will be asking this question. If you haven\\'t heard of Rivian Automotive yet, here\\'s a quick rundown. Image source: Rivian Automotive. Based in Plymouth, Michigan, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence Rivian Automotive set up shop back in 2009 (although we didn\\'t start hearing a lot about it until just last year). The company hasn\\'t begun operations yet, really, but plans to begin selling its first two electric trucks, the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, in late 2020. Kelley Blue Book advises that both models will seat at least five passengers, with the R1S having an optional three-row, seven-passenger configuration. As all-electric vehicles, they will not have a gas engine -- but may not need one to allay consumers\\' range anxiety, because both vehicles will be rated for between 300 and 410 miles fully charged. \\xa0 Because they\\'re trucks, they\\'ll boast significant towing capacity -- 11,000 pounds for the R1T and 7,700 pounds for the R1S. And because they\\'re electric, they\\'ll be able to go really fast when not towing a boat or camper -- accelerating from 0 to 60 in as little as three seconds. Neither truck will be cheap. Rivian expects to price the R1T at $69,000 to start, and the R1S at $72,500, both prices before state and federal tax credits. Now admittedly, none of this information will make much difference to consumers (or investors) if Rivian goes bust, or fails to produce the products it\\'s promised. But recent financing rounds suggest that Rivian will in fact have the cash it needs to go the distance. Last year, for example, Rivian attracted a $700 million investment from a consortium led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which later awarded Rivian a contract to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans specially designed for Amazon\\'s use. (Deliveries will begin in 2020 or 2021, and continue through 2024). \\xa0 In swift succession, Rivian won a further $500 million investment from a company you\\'d think would consider it a rival -- Ford -- and $350 million from privately held Cox Automotive. Those investments alone probably would have been enough to make Rivian a viable contender to Tesla, which has an SUV of its own on the market already (Model X), and announced an electric pickup truck offering in November (Cybertruck). But in the waning days of December, Rivian won an even bigger investment -- more money than Ford and Amazon ponied up, combined. On Monday, December 23, Rivian announced it had secured a $1.3 billion investment from \"funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.\" With that money in hand, Rivian ended the year with nearly $3 billion in new funding. Given that the company already has a production plant to build in (Mitsubishi\\'s old plant in Normal, Illinois), $3 billion should be just enough cash to develop the three closely related truck/van models revealed so far. According to autoblog.com, the average cost to develop new cars is about $1 billion per model. \\xa0 Of course, the question still remains: Will Rivian\\'s trucks sell? According to Wall Street Journal auto reporter Dan Neil, \"we are living through the S-curve of EV adoption,\" and 2020 could very well become the year of the electric \"car.\" That being said, there are going to be a lot of electric cars coming to market this year to choose from, with more than a dozen new models coming on line to compete with existing fare such as Tesla\\'s Models S, 3, and X and Nissan\\'s Leaf. \\xa0 Although it\\'s hard to keep track of all the moving parts, WSJ alone highlights Volvo\\'s XC40 Recharge, Ford\\'s Mustang Mach-E, and Mini\\'s Mini Cooper SE as viable contenders in addition to Tesla\\'s and Nissan\\'s wares. At starting prices ranging from $60,500 (Ford) to just $30,750 (Mini), each of these new rivals underprices Rivian\\'s offering. \\xa0 One thing Rivian has got, however, that everyone else has not: Last week, Rivian released a video demonstrating its new \"tank turn\" feature that will be available for both the R1T and R1S. Like a modern main battle tank, the truck\\'s four electric motors can spin in different directions, enabling the truck to literally turn on a dime -- spinning itself around a fixed point. \\xa0 Probably thought up as a way to market the truck to off-roaders initially, this feature would also make Rivian\\'s truck incredibly maneuverable in tight spaces, such as might be encountered on construction sites, in crowded driveways, and parking garages -- the latter perhaps a valuable selling point to suburban shoppers. Combined with the right software, I suspect Rivian\\'s tank-turn feature will also make parallel parking in even the tightest spaces a breeze. Long story short, yes, this truck will sell. Now, all Rivian needs to do is build it.  10 stocks we like better than\\xa0WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

An investment of just $100 per month at an annualized return of 12% over 50 years can grow to $3.9 million.\\xa0 Three stocks that can help you achieve those returns are\\xa0Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here\\'s why these stocks should remain compounding machines for the next 50 years. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet\\'s Google is still benefiting from the shift of ad spending moving online. Its range of products and platforms, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, and Gmail, each have over one billion users.\\xa0That\\'s attractive to advertisers, and it\\'s why Google is the No. 3 most valuable brand in the world, according to Brand Finance.\\xa0 However, over the next 50 years, Alphabet will likely generate significant amounts of revenue from other businesses. The one analysts are watching heading into 2020 is Google Cloud.\\xa0Google\\'s \"other revenue\" that includes Google Cloud, Google Play, Google Home, and other hardware products has been Alphabet\\'s fastest-growing segment in the last few years, and it may reach 20% of the company\\'s total revenue in 2020.\\xa0 There are not many companies as forward-thinking as Alphabet that have the resources to invest billions in new growth avenues. The company considers its investments in moonshot opportunities, or \"other bets,\" as vital to its future success.\\xa0These other bets include potential world-changers, such as self-driving cars with Waymo, or growth opportunities in life sciences with Verily.\\xa0 Don\\'t let Alphabet\\'s $992 billion market cap make you think the stock has already run its course.\\xa0The company has more than doubled its revenue and earnings over the last five years,\\xa0and given its forward-thinking corporate culture, Alphabet should continue to grow for many years. Moving one spot below Google on Brand Finance\\'s most valuable brand list is Microsoft, at No. 4.\\xa0The software giant has been making essential tools for people to get stuff done for decades. Microsoft has over 900 million Windows 10 users.\\xa0Under CEO Sadya Nadella, the company has spread its reach well beyond the PC to mobile devices and the cloud. Microsoft has the brand recognition, network effect advantage, and resources to continue winning in the markets it serves. Its Office software is still in high demand after all these years. Even though Apple\\xa0has 1.4 billion users of its devices,\\xa0the familiarity people have with Apple\\'s software hasn\\'t dethroned Microsoft\\'s Word and Excel. Office commercial products, including 365 subscriptions, have been growing fast, up 25% year over year in the most recent quarter.\\xa0 Also, businesses are continuing to use cloud-based tools to handle IT services. The infrastructure-as-a-service cloud market is expected to grow three times faster than traditional IT services through 2022, according to Gartner.\\xa0Microsoft Azure has tremendous momentum in this space, with revenue surging 59% year over year in the last quarter.\\xa0 Microsoft has proven it can adapt its basic software services to the cloud and develop new cloud-based platforms for businesses, such as Dynamics 365 and Azure.\\xa0The ability to adapt to changing environments in technology gives me confidence that the company will still be around in 50 years. It offers good growth prospects, high margins,\\xa0and a growing stream of dividends. Owning the stock seems like a no-brainer for the 21st\\xa0century. Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Tesla is not short of investor attention. The stock has experienced a meteoric rise since its initial public offering in 2010, but the sky truly is the limit for Elon Musk\\'s company. Some on Wall Street are debating whether it\\'s time to sell the stock after the share price more than doubled off of its lows last year.\\xa0But I think long-term investors should stay the course, and if you don\\'t already own shares, you should consider starting a small position. Tesla is at the center of a secular trend sweeping the world, as alternative forms of energy are increasingly in demand for everything from how homes are built to what fuels our cars. Tesla is known for its Model S, Model X, and Model 3 electric vehicles, but it defines its mission as helping the world accelerate to sustainable energy through various energy products, including solar electricity.\\xa0The company has installed thousands of solar products for consumers since 2006, and last year, it released Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.\\xa0 You can\\'t underestimate a visionary leader like Musk, who has demonstrated a great talent for seeing an opportunity and starting a business to capture it.\\xa0As Tesla approaches a $100 billion market cap,\\xa0the company still has a tiny share of the nearly 100 million vehicles shipped in the industry every year.\\xa0There were about 367,500 Tesla vehicles delivered in 2019, for an increase of 50% year over year.\\xa0That growth is thanks to the Model 3, which went into production in 2017 and comes at a much more affordable price for the masses.\\xa0 However, Musk believes the upcoming Model Y will outsell the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined.\\xa0As Tesla releases more models, builds Gigafactories around the world,\\xa0increases scale, and brings prices down for these cars,\\xa0it\\'s inevitable the company will hit the one-million delivery mark at some point. There is enormous upside for the Tesla brand over the next 50 years. All three stocks are already large caps, but each could keep heading higher from here. Consider that\\xa0Coca-Cola\\xa0started in 1886,\\xa0but the stock is still increasing in value for shareholders.\\xa0Walt Disney\\xa0was started in 1923,\\xa0but the stock is up 355% over the last 10 years. Great growth stocks continue to find ways to deliver returns for shareholders, and I believe Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla will be no different.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Trade matters, though, to oil and gas producers. The U.S. is not only the world\\'s leading producer of oil and gas, but it also became a net exporter of petroleum for the first time in September. It\\'s now essentially tied with Saudi Arabia as the biggest oil exporter in the world.\\xa0 A lot of that oil and gas heads to Canada and Mexico. Fully 29.2% of exported petroleum and 75% of exported natural gas heads to one of our two neighbors. That makes the Canadian and Mexican markets vitally important for the five biggest U.S. oil producers \\xa0ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX),\\xa0EOG Resources\\xa0(NYSE: EOG),\\xa0ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY)\\xa0and numerous smaller producers, too. Here\\'s how the USMCA deal is likely to affect them. The oil and gas industry didn\\'t feature prominently in USMCA coverage, but exports are a top concern for U.S. producers. Image source: Getty Images. The initial version of the USMCA was ratified in September 2018. However, negotiations between the White House and Congress have prompted some changes. Trouble is, a final version hasn\\'t been released yet, so we have to rely on the September 2018 version, along with comments (or the lack thereof) made by various politicians about what was changed and what stayed the same. What stayed the same was...just about everything, apparently. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley notoriously said in 2018 that \"95% of [the USMCA] is the same as NAFTA.\" With the recent changes, that may have -- maybe -- dropped to 90% or even 85%, but the bulk of the agreement is the same. In particular, for ExxonMobil and its top oil-producing peers, that includes the 0% preferential tariff rate on oil and gas exports, as well as automatic export approval. This isn\\'t unexpected, but it\\'s a huge win for the industry, as tariffs would likely have jeopardized the U.S.\\'s newfound status as a leading energy exporter.\\xa0 One major change that appears to have been made to the final version of the USMCA involves the controversial \"Chapter 11.\" No, not bankruptcy: NAFTA Chapter 11 dealt with disputes between a company located in one NAFTA country and the government of another NAFTA country. It provided for a way to resolve those disputes without going through the court system of the government in question. The reason Chapter 11 came into existence was out of fear that a new government in one country could come into power and rewrite regulations or laws that would suddenly prohibit projects into which companies or investors in another country had already sunk a lot of money. Well, Chapter 11 is now mostly gone, except for a handful of industries...one of which is oil and gas. That\\'s right: U.S. oil and gas companies -- which had just been granted admittance to Mexico in 2013 for the first time since 1938 -- were worried that a potential new government in Mexico might try to renationalize the industry and boot them from the country again. So they lobbied hard to keep their Chapter 11 rights in the USMCA, and it looks like they prevailed.\\xa0 The last changes of any significance for Chevron and the other top U.S. producers are some tricky little regulations surrounding determining country of origin of oil and gas and their derivatives.\\xa0 Without getting too bogged down in the details, basically NAFTA put the burden on a product exporter to prove that the country of origin of its product was a NAFTA country, and provided limited ways to do so. USMCA instead puts the onus on the\\xa0importer, and provides multiple new ways to go about making the determination. In particular, hydrocarbons transported by pipeline can now be qualified in most cases, which wasn\\'t true before. Because U.S. companies are more often exporters of oil than importers, the change is a net benefit for them. While some industries, including the automotive industry, saw substantial changes between NAFTA and USMCA, and between the 2018 USMCA and the newest version, not a lot seems to have changed for the oil and gas industry. But the alterations that have happened look like unqualified wins for ConocoPhillips, EOG, Occidental Petroleum, Exxon, Chevron, and even the smaller U.S. oil producers.\\xa0 However, it\\'s important to realize that the final version hasn\\'t yet been ratified, and until that happens, there\\'s always the chance something could go awry for the industry. For now, though, it looks like a Christmas present for U.S. oil and gas from our neighbors.  10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobilWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After major indices reached all-time highs the day before Thanksgiving, the last seven sessions have seen uneven and modestly negative trading. That includes declines on Monday with stocks closing at session lows.   For skeptics who believe markets have run too far, recent trading might suggest that markets have peaked. For those still bullish on U.S. stocks, the modest pullback looks like a breather ahead of more gains. Tuesday’s big stock charts highlight names that might be of interest to the latter group. All three charts highlight stocks that seem to have the potential for a reversal. The potential seems even higher if investors are willing to take on more risk, which could boost two of those stocks — and perhaps lead the market to look beyond the third for returns.    Ahead of Monday’s 14% gain, there was some evidence that Canopy Growth (NYSE:) had the potential to break out. After the jump, the first of Tuesday’s big stock charts gives some hope that the breakout can continue:    Energy is another sector that has struggled over the past six months, and EOG Resources (NYSE:) hasn’t been immune to the sell-off. But, like CGC, EOG is showing signs of life, and the second of our big stock charts suggests a recent rally could continue:    The third of Tuesday’s big stock charts, Medtronic (NYSE:), also signals a potential reversal — but in the wrong direction: As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.

Investors sold CHK off when management raised “going concern” issues. However, recent debt financing deals have bought it more time.   Such a deal may make a recovery in CHK stock possible. However, recent successes in the oil patch have supplied the market with too much oil and gas. Given this reduced pricing, I would not recommend a speculative play in Chesapeake Energy stock. In the last earnings report, the company called into question its future as “going concern.” At that point, I sold my own speculative position, and it has fallen since that time. The problem for CHK stock is that the oil and gas boom has become a victim of its own success. The United States now produces so much oil and gas that these assets continue to lose value. Chevron (NYSE:) just announced that they would take between $10 billion and $11 billion in write-downs in the fourth quarter as a result. One has to assume that ExxonMobil (NYSE:),\\xa0EOG Resources\\xa0(NYSE:), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:), and other oil majors could follow suit. The company holds $9.34 billion in long-term debt, a crushing burden for a company with only a $1.5 billion market cap. Falling oil and gas prices and asset write-downs have dimmed the prospects of reducing that debt. Moreover, the move to buy Wildhorse Resources to sell more oil may have backfired as oil prices have also failed to gain traction. That said, the company has again made CHK stock alluring with the latest . One deal comes in the form of a $1.5 billion, 4.5-year loan facility that retired an existing revolving credit facility worth about $900 million. Under a separate debt agreement, it will issue . These will come due in 2025 and carry an 11.5% coupon. They will also finance the retirement of some debts at 62 cents and 70 cents on the dollar. While this appears strange, some of the bonds traded below 50 cents on the dollar, as . Hence, these bondholders still benefit. Moreover, these deals buy Chesapeake more time to clean up its balance sheet. All of this has helped take the CHK stock price back up to around 75 cents per share. Some stock market detractors refer to investing in equities as “gambling.” In most cases, I object to that view. However, that viewpoint may describe CHK stock accurately. I say this because  describes Chesapeake’s situation accurately. Not only must they execute a fourth-and-long play flawlessly, factors which the company does not control must also go right. To be sure, a lot could go wrong for Chesapeake Energy stock. The previously-mentioned asset write-downs do not bode well for the industry. Moreover, the U.S.-China trade dispute makes prospects for selling in China tenuous. The falling cost of renewables could also further dampen the demand for fossil fuels. That push for renewables could accelerate further if a Democrat wins the White House in 2020. Investors who feel they can prevail amid the above conditions may choose to buy. A 100% loss of one’s investment is a real possibility. However, if Chesapeake’s management has run the right play, and some factors that they do not control go right, the returns on CHK stock could run several multiples above 100%. Still, with the risks involved, this is not a move that I encourage. CHK stock has become a gamble with increasingly longer odds. Falling energy prices and statements from management have cast doubts about the future of Chesapeake. The company inspired some optimism with new debt financing deals. However, conditions continue to worsen as energy prices fail to gain traction. Moreover, geopolitical uncertainties and the increased viability of so-called “clean” energy solutions could add to the revenue pressure. If the company manages to clean up its balance sheet, CHK stock will rise exponentially. However, failure could lead to bankruptcy, and external market conditions continue to bode poorly for the company. Given the worsening market environment, I would not recommend a speculative position here. As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.

The U.S. oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, is currently right around $58 per barrel. While that's well below its high of more than $65 a barrel, it's still up more than 27% for the year. Despite the overall improvement in the price of oil, most energy stocks have lost value this year, given that the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF is down about 20% year to date. That slump in oil stocks doesn't make much sense, especially when several producers can thrive at the current oil price. Three that are doing just that are ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG). And they're all great oil stocks to buy right now. Image source: Getty Images. ConocoPhillips has been putting up excellent numbers all year. Through the third quarter, the U.S. oil giant has produced $4 billion of free cash flow, with oil prices in the U.S. that have averaged about $57 per barrel this year. The company has returned nearly all that money to investors through its dividend and share repurchase plan. However, despite that strong financial performance, its shares have fallen by about 3% this year.  Because of that underperformance, ConocoPhillips' stock looks like an excellent buy, given what it sees ahead. The company recently unveiled its 10-year plan, which would see it generate a jaw-dropping $50 billion free cash flow, assuming oil averages $50 a barrel. That will give it the money to continue paying a growing dividend as well as buy back another $30 billion in stock. For perspective, that's enough money to retire nearly half its outstanding shares at the current price. The company's ability to generate a gusher of free cash flow at lower oil prices should enable it to produce strong total returns in the coming years. Earlier this year, Devon Energy laid out a bold transformation plan to focus all its attention on its four oil-rich U.S. shale assets. That strategy is clearly delivering results. One of the highlights is that the company is on track to generate more than $3 billion in excess cash this year thanks to a combination of free cash flow and asset sales. It has used those funds to pay off debt and repurchase stock. As a result, it now has one of the lowest leverage ratios in the oil patch. It's also on track to reduce its outstanding share count by 30% from its peak level in 2017. Despite all that success, its stock is only up about 1% on the year.  Devon's new strategy has it well positioned to prosper in the coming years. In 2020, it can generate enough cash at $48 oil to pay its dividend as well as drill the new wells needed to grow its oil production by 7% to 9%. Because of that low oil price breakeven level, the company can generate a gusher of free cash flow at higher prices. For example, if crude averages around $55 a barrel next year, Devon could produce $400 million in free cash. That's enough to repurchase another 4.5% of its outstanding stock at the current price. Image source: Getty Images. EOG Resources has also delivered excellent operational and financial results this year. During the third quarter, for example, its oil production was up 12% year over year, coming in above the high end of its target range. Meanwhile, the company produced $2 billion in cash. That was enough money to cover its rapidly growing dividend as well as its capital expenses with more than $300 million to spare, bringing its year-to-date free cash flow total to $774 million.  CEO Bill Thomas commented on the company's performance: EOG's operating performance has never been better. The company generated outstanding financial results in the third quarter driven by improvements in every area. We reduced operating expenses, grew volumes at double‐digit rates while lowering well costs and generated substantial free cash flow. EOG has never been in a better position to sustain this success long into the future.  That's evident by its initial outlook for 2020. The company expects to deliver similar results next year, with it aiming to grow its oil output by a double-digit rate while producing free cash as long as oil is above $50 a barrel. That will give it the funds to grow its dividend while also continuing to strengthen what's already one of the top balance sheets in the sector. Meanwhile, with shares of the oil company declining by about 15% this year despite its strong performance, investors can buy this top-notch oil stock for an excellent price. ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, and EOG Resources are in an elite group of oil stocks. All have top-tier balance sheets and ultra-low costs, which enables them to generate a gusher of free cash flow at low oil prices. They all have the potential to produce some big-time total returns once the market realizes how well they can perform at current oil prices. That makes them excellent oil stocks to buy right now with the long term in mind.  10 stocks we like better than Devon EnergyWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Including the stock's intraday 6.4% gain as of 11:15 a.m. EST on Wednesday, shares are up more than 140% over the past four months. The stock's sharp gain on Wednesday follows yet another analyst's decision to increase his 12-month price target for the electric-car maker's stock ahead of earnings on Jan. 29. Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors on Wednesday that he believes the company's fourth-quarter earnings and its guidance for vehicle deliveries will not disappoint investors when Tesla reports results later this month. He believes there's robust demand for vehicles in China and Europe. Further, he is particularly bullish on the company's opportunity in China following the start of production at the company's Shanghai factory earlier this year. The opportunity for Tesla in the China market is worth $100 to $300 per share, Ives estimates. The analyst boosted his price target for the stock to $550 -- up from a $370 price target previously. The analyst has a neutral rating on the stock. In addition to reporting its financial results for its fourth quarter on Jan. 29, Tesla will also likely provide guidance for vehicle deliveries in 2020. The automaker saw deliveries rise 50% year over year in 2019, and investors are expecting more sharp growth this year.

The sector was once an excellent place for income-seeking investors to get above-average yields. However, when oil prices fell off their triple-digit perch a few years ago, it took many of the sector's dividends down with it. The industry has worked hard since that time to deal with its new reality of lower oil prices by cutting costs. These efforts have been paying dividends. That has allowed producers to begin sending more cash to their investors once again. And that means income-focused investors should start paying closer attention to this sector. Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy (NYSE: WPX) has been working hard over the past few years to reshape its business. The company sold several assets to reduce debt as well as finance its expansion program in the low-cost, oil-rich Permian Basin. Those moves were all part of a strategy to begin returning cash to its investors by 2021.  Last year was a pivotal one for the oil and gas company as it reached its debt reduction target. The company entered 2019 needing oil to average only about $50 a barrel to fund its expansion plan. However, thanks to higher oil prices, additional asset sales, excellent operating results, and a needle-moving acquisition, WPX Energy was able to accelerate its capital return program. It started by authorizing a $400 million share repurchase program in August. It has since initiated a quarterly dividend, which it will begin paying after closing its latest acquisition. While that payout's implied yield of 0.8% might not be all the appealing to income-seeking investors, WPX Energy should have the fuel to grow its dividend at a healthy rate in the coming years, which makes it more attractive.  Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy is joining many of its peers in starting small. However, what these payouts have lacked in size, they've more than made up for with growth. Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), for example, initiated a small dividend last year, which yielded around 0.5%. The company boosted that payout by 50% earlier this year and now yields about 0.9%. With Diamondback on track to generate a gusher of free cash in 2020 if oil remains at its current level, it will probably give its investors another sizable raise next year as well as buy back a big chunk of its stock.  Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD), meanwhile, had been paying its investors a paltry dividend for many years. However, the company started increasing it at a rapid pace in 2018. This year alone, Pioneer doubled its payout in February and then boosted it by another 175% in August. As a result, it has now increased its dividend by an eye-popping 2,100% in the last two years, driving its yield up to 1.2%. Oil giants ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), likewise, have boosted their payouts at impressive rates. ConocoPhillips was one of several oil stocks that slashed its dividend as a result of crashing crude prices a few years ago. However, it has been growing at an accelerated rate in recent years. The company started with a 6% increase in 2016 and followed that up with two more last year -- 7.5% in February and another 7% in December -- before giving its investors a monster 38% raise this October. With that latest increase, ConocoPhillips now yields an above-average 2.7%. EOG Recourses, on the other hand, kept its payout flat during the darkest days of the oil market downturn. It has since restarted its dividend growth engine, giving its investors two raises last year and another 31% increase this year. As a result, it now yields about 1.5%. More high-octane growth, however, is up ahead, given that the company aims to push its yield up to at least the level of the S&P 500, which is around 2%. While most oil stocks don't pay high yields these days, many are growing their payouts at rapid rates. That's noteworthy, considering that dividend growth stocks have historically produced the highest total returns. That's why income investors might want to consider adding a dividend-paying oil stock to their portfolio since they could generate some high-octane total returns in the coming years as they keep increasing their payouts at a fast pace.  10 stocks we like better than ConocoPhillipsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After a rough last five years of revamping its portfolio in an effort to adjust to the new reality of $50 to $70 oil, will Exxon be able to turn it around or will the next five years bring similar results?  XOM data by YCharts On paper, Exxon\\'s stock looks pretty attractive. A\\xa0price-to-earnings ratio of 20 and a 5 percent dividend yield place Exxon among both value stocks and dividend stocks, but the company is in growth mode, too. Image Source: Getty Images. In March, ExxonMobil announced its plans to \"accelerate Permian output to 1 million barrels per day by 2024.\" The Permian Basin is the nation\\'s hottest shale play, producing nearly 5 million barrels per day, which is more than a third of total U.S. output and nearly half of U.S. onshore production. Exxon\\'s announcement included the following takeaways: Exxon\\'s quest comes at a steep cost. The energy stock was able to have such a massive increase in 2018 Permian production thanks to a $6.6 billion purchase of acreage in 2017. Since then, Exxon has continued to expand its Permian operations, and according to Argus Media, which tracks global energy business, \"unconventional output rose by 72% from a year earlier to 293,000 BOE/D [barrels of oil equivalent per day] in the third quarter of 2019.\" Meanwhile, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is on track to raise its Permian output to 900,000 BOE/D by 2023.\\xa0 Aside from its Permian focus, ExxonMobil\\'s 45% stake in the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana is another multi-billion dollar investment. ExxonMobil expects the Stabroek Block to produce 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025, bolstered by up to 120,000 barrels of production from the Liza Phase 1 development starting in 2020.\\xa0ExxonMobil began producing oil from its Liza Destiny floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) in December.\\xa0 In addition to Guyana, Exxon is making multi-billion dollar investments in the growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that 50 countries will be importing LNG by 2025, up from 10 at the start of the century.Exxon is the operator of the $19 billion Papa New Guinea LNG Project, the operations of which have the capacity to produce over 8 million tonnes of LNG annually.\\xa0In terms of other LNG projects, Exxon is ramping up investment in the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique. Recently announced in October 2019, the company plans to invest more than $500 million in the initial construction phase of the project which now has a capacity of over 15 million tonnes of LNG annually.\\xa0 Exxon has also made bids for the \"pre-salt\" offshore blocks off the coast of Brazil, one of the largest discoveries over the past few decades. For the time being, uncertainty surrounds Exxon\\'s involvement in these offshore blocks after the November 2019 asset auction\\xa0went bust.\\xa0 There\\'s been a running theme for the large integrated oil and gas company:\\xa0Divest away from stodgy, long-term payoff plays and into quick returns now available in the shale basins throughout the United States. For Exxon, the divestments are fairly extreme,\\xa0totaling $4.8 billion against $8.7 billion in earnings, and capital expenditures of $22.7 billion as of the nine months ended Sept. 30.\\xa0 Exxon operates a system from the wellhead to your car in an effort to balance the risks associated with just exploring for and producing hydrocarbons or solely refining them. The upstream side of oil and gas is typically termed a commodity business, whereas the downstream side is a margin game based on the lowest input cost for a barrel of oil and the highest output of gasoline and distillates. In early September 2019, the number of onshore operating drilling rigs in the United States\\xa0fell below 900 for the first time since 2017. Today, the rig count is 800, more or less. The Baker Hughes Rig Count acts as a yardstick for onshore drilling contractors, which Exxon hires to drill new wells. Despite a trend of fewer rigs, Exxon has 55 operational rigs in the Permian Basin as of the third quarter of 2019, up from 51 in the second quarter and 46 in the first quarter.\\xa0But that\\'s just the upstream side. In addition to its rising upstream portfolio, Exxon has the\\xa0second-largest refining capacity\\xa0in the world. When crude prices are down, Exxon\\'s refinery margins improve since low-priced Permian oil can feed cheaply and efficiently into Exxon\\'s vast downstream refining infrastructure along the Gulf Coast. In terms of downstream growth, Exxon is currently developing 18 refining and petrochemical facilities. Next year, ExxonMobil will celebrate the 150-year anniversary of its predecessor, Standard Oil. In five years, Exxon plans to become one of the largest producers (if not the largest one) out of the Permian Basin. On the flip side, ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), the world\\'s largest independent exploration and production (E&P) company, unveiled a 10-year savings and operations plan that reflects tighter spending in an effort to increase investor confidence by rewarding shareholders with strong dividends built upon consistent free cash flow. ConocoPhillips lowered its capital expenditure budget to roughly $7 billion per year through 2029. Total cash flow generation is expected to be $50 billion with a 3% annual output growth based on \"a real West Texas Intermediate price of $50 per barrel.\" \\xa0 In addition to ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) is also cutting spending in an effort to deleverage its balance sheet after its acquisition of Anadarko. Occidental also\\xa0estimated that its capital budget will decrease from $9.0 billion in 2019 to somewhere in the $5.3\\xa0billion to $5.5 billion range in 2020, which is expected to generate production growth of 2% in the year. Tying it all together, ExxonMobil is raising money from divestments to fund Permian Basin expansion projects\\xa0aimed at producing hydrocarbons quickly and at a low cost that it can then feed into its immense refinery network. The company\\'s quick return Permian assets aim to pair nicely with its large offshore projects and focus on LNG. Exxon should be able to make these investments while raising its dividend, as it has done for 37 consecutive years. The company has increased its dividend by more than 100% in the past 10 years alone. In sum, Exxon and Chevron could be able to pull ahead from independents like ConocoPhillips and Occidental as spending tightens for E&Ps. Although the last five years were tough on Exxon, it seems the company has adjusted well to the new energy environment and could have a bright future.  10 stocks we like better than ExxonMobilWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Although the  of 2012-2014 are unlikely to return this year, investors should not be too quick to dismiss the sector. New tensions between the U.S. and Iran, following the killing of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, might trigger a resurgence in oil prices. A renewed boom in the oil markets requires two things to happen. First, oil prices must firm up and rise throughout 2020. Destabilization in the Middle East might speed up the rise in oil prices. Unfortunately, this will hurt other spaces like airlines, automobile manufacturing and consumer discretionary. Rising energy prices increase costs for such goods and would put pressure on demand. Second, OPEC must maintain or further lower output to keep energy prices high. So far, the Gulf Nations are keeping output constrained and are even cutting deliveries . To manage your portfolioÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s returns effectively, you will need to consider increasing your weighting in energy to offset a drop in the other sectors. With that said, here are seven energy stocks you should buy in light of a resurgence of the oil boom.    Stuck in a trading range for months, BP plcÃ\\x82Â\\xa0(NYSE:) is an integrated oil and gas firm that steadily shed assets after the Gulf of Mexico spill in 2010. At these levels, the stock is a good income play for conservative investors and for those looking for steady retirement income. BP modeled oil prices to fall to the $40 Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x93 $50 range in the near-term. But because prices are now at the $60 level, investors should expect the company to bounce back sharply from its extremely weak third-quarter report. BP  year over year due to Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9clower liquids and gas realizations.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d Poor weather conditions hurt results too. Despite its weak quarter, BP continued to apply its underlying cash flow to buy back stock, pay a quarterly dividend and to cover its capex spend. Record results at its Whiting and Cherry Point refineries, plus expansion in the Spanish power market, suggest growth from diversified sources. This lowers BPÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s reliance on an oil price rebound. Investors may consider Q4 another headwind as it books costs. And since the market is forward-looking, the seasonal maintenance costs and turnaround activities for upstream will follow-up with revenue growth ahead. Similarly, BPÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s lower industry refining margins for downstream will reverse, too.    Similar to BP, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:) is stuck in a narrow trading range at around $70. The companyÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s asset sale improves its balance sheet, but higher oil prices will push profits to better levels. ExxonÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s  from Norway will raise $3.6 billion, offsetting weak performance for its refining and chemicals business. Oil production levels are still unchanged from the last quarter. Still, Q3 results are steady and have room to grow now that energy market prospects are improving. Exxon reported earnings of $3.2 billion. Cash flow jumped sharply from $6 billion in Q2 to $9.5 billion from Q3, due mostly to asset sales. Upstream global gas realizations are still a challenge, but growth in the Permian will help production. Investors should not expect Upstream rebounding by much, but the higher oil prices should still offset its underperformance. Income investors should praise Exxon managementÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s commitment to the dividend. The company raised the dividend by 6%, marking the 37th consecutive year of dividend growth. Management said : Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cThe strength of our balance sheet provides us with the capacity to invest through the cycle with leverage at just 12%.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d Ongoing commitments to projects like the one in Tengiz, despite the , is still of strategic importance for ExxonÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s long-term growth. But if Exxon leverages its scale and manages cost pressures, the project will add meaning to profits in the future.    Despite a big write-down, Chevron (NYSE:) stock is holding up. Markets are betting that the $10-$11 billion write-down is a one-time event that sets the bottom to ChevronÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s near-term costs. More than half of the write-down is related to the Appalachia shale unit. But by holding the $20 billion worth of organic capital spending levels, the company will benefit from a return on capital as the market improves. Chevron will take a disciplined cost control approach with gas-related opportunities. It said it Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cwill reduce funding to various gas-related opportunities including Appalachia shale, Kitimat LNG, and other international projects.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d CVX stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 17, which reflects investor appreciation over managementÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s candidness. But the honest commentary posted on the Dec. 10 press release happened when oil prices were still moving sideways. Now that the commodity is firming up, Chevron has a good chance of finding success as competitors with a weaker balance sheet flounder. Chevron has $2.8 billion budgeted for capital spending related to its downstream business. $1.6 billion will be spent on U.S downstream while international downstream will be $1.2 billion. Improving oil prices should give both the downstream and upstream markets a positive lift. The average price target on CVX stock is $138.88. Investors who forecast no revenue growth ahead in the next 10 years will arrive at an even  (from a finbox.io model) than analysts.    ConocoPhillips (NYSE:) pays investors a modest dividend in the 2.5% range and erased most of 2019Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s lows. Even after the strong performance on the market, the stock still trades in the sub-10 P/E multiple. At an analyst and investor  in November 2019, the company highlighted the 2012-14 oil price highs at $100 per barrel. It noted the energy sectorÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s weighting on in the S&P 500 fell from 12% to 4%. Despite the weakened importance of energy, ConocoPhillips believes it is resilient to the falling energy market. It allocates capital responsibly by measuring its return. The company posted 2019 full-year free cash flow (FCF) yield topping 9%. This had assumed oil would be at the consensus $57 per barrel. But low stock valuations and a higher return on capital at low oil prices suggest the stock will reward investors in 2020. COP noted the 12% return on capital for the full year is a strong turnaround from the negative 4% in 2016. Further, it : Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cThe improvements across all these metrics set the stage for the 10-year plan youÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99ll see today. We are stronger now than we were three years ago and we plan to get stronger over the next decade and will keep our focus on these drivers of value.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d Investors could ignore the unlikely scenario where the company does not grow in the next few years. In a dividend discount model with stable growth, COP stock  over $73 a share.    With a dividend that yields over 6%, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:) (NYSE:RDS.B) will appeal to both income investors and energy investors. In the third quarter, the company, best known for its Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cShellÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d gas stations, posted strong cash flow generation. The Integrated Gas and Oil Products division contributed to the $12.1 billion in operations and free cash flow of $10.1 billion. Earnings of $4.8 billion were hurt by lower prices and margins. And although strong trading ahead will lift results, higher energy prices will help revenue grow faster than previously expected. Integrated gas added $2.7 billion in Royal DutchÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s $4.8 billion in earnings. Downstream added $2.2 billion in earnings. RDS will still grow its business even if the energy resurgence plays out slower than expected. When speaking about the liquefied natural gas market, : Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cNot only do we expect growing demand, [but] we also see a supply gap emerging in the mid-2020s, once the current wave of new liquefaction capacity has been absorbed. Consequently, we are seeing continued interest in long-term contracts from LNG buyers.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d It already established its market in Hong Kong after it signed long-term agreements from LNG buyers. As its LNG terminal services the Asian market, Royal Dutch may grow its cash flow and increase returns from a market outside of oil. LNG contracting will give the company a predictable revenue stream. Long-term contracts provide price stability. And for 2020, its price review has no changes. In fact, Royal Dutch already expects positive price changes and has its outlook ready for 2025.    Even after a steady uptrend, Enbridge (NYSE:) shares still pay a generous dividend. In fact, the company recently raised its dividend by 9.8% on Dec. 10. This boring pipeline company is a solid, long-term holding that investors should consider holding. Even though higher oil prices will not directly help Enbridge, the resurgence in the sector will give investors a reason to hold ENB stock. The company has resilient energy infrastructure in liquid pipelines, gas transmission and gas distribution in storage. Growing global demand for energy is undeniable. By 2040, demand will . According to ENB, this demand stems from world population growth of 27%, urbanization increasing 16% and the global middle class increasing 67%. Enbridge forecasts discounted cash flow per share of $4.50 Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x93 $4.80 in the full-year 2020. And beyond 2020, DCF/share growth will be in the range of 5% Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x93 7%. The companyÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s priority on improving its balance sheet will lower risks for shareholders. Enbridge is aiming to have a Debt/EBITDA ratio at 4.5 times to below 5 times. Add the $6.5 billion in dividend payments in 2020 and organic growth and income investors will continue accumulating the stock.    HalliburtonÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s (NYSE:) revenue decline may end as the resurgence in oil begins. In the third quarter, revenue fell 6% to $5.6 billion, while earnings fell 3% to $536 million. Still, investors may anticipate international market strength continuing and a rebound in its North American business in 2020. Uncertainties in the period hurt supply and demand, led by Iran sanctions and production falling in Venezuela. Supply constraints, due to political instability in Africa and Latin America hurt Q3 results. But the Phase 1 U.S. and China trade deal should drive energy demand higher. Plus, HalliburtonÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s drilling and exploration business will have a strong return if the long-term global demand for energy trends higher. On its conference call, : Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cOur Drilling and Evaluation division traditionally had the most exposure to international markets, with about 70% of division revenues coming from outside North America.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d The industry is maximizing returns from mature fields. And as drilling activity expands, Halliburton has strong growth potential ahead, regardless of the surge in energy prices. The companyÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s 2020 outlook is bright. International topline and margin growth opportunities will increase. With a global slowdown unlikely, HAL stock will likely continue its uptrend that started in the last few months.

But Rivian Automotive? What the heck is that? By the time 2020 is out, I suspect absolutely no one will be asking this question. If you haven\\'t heard of Rivian Automotive yet, here\\'s a quick rundown. Image source: Rivian Automotive. Based in Plymouth, Michigan, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence Rivian Automotive set up shop back in 2009 (although we didn\\'t start hearing a lot about it until just last year). The company hasn\\'t begun operations yet, really, but plans to begin selling its first two electric trucks, the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, in late 2020. Kelley Blue Book advises that both models will seat at least five passengers, with the R1S having an optional three-row, seven-passenger configuration. As all-electric vehicles, they will not have a gas engine -- but may not need one to allay consumers\\' range anxiety, because both vehicles will be rated for between 300 and 410 miles fully charged. \\xa0 Because they\\'re trucks, they\\'ll boast significant towing capacity -- 11,000 pounds for the R1T and 7,700 pounds for the R1S. And because they\\'re electric, they\\'ll be able to go really fast when not towing a boat or camper -- accelerating from 0 to 60 in as little as three seconds. Neither truck will be cheap. Rivian expects to price the R1T at $69,000 to start, and the R1S at $72,500, both prices before state and federal tax credits. Now admittedly, none of this information will make much difference to consumers (or investors) if Rivian goes bust, or fails to produce the products it\\'s promised. But recent financing rounds suggest that Rivian will in fact have the cash it needs to go the distance. Last year, for example, Rivian attracted a $700 million investment from a consortium led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which later awarded Rivian a contract to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans specially designed for Amazon\\'s use. (Deliveries will begin in 2020 or 2021, and continue through 2024). \\xa0 In swift succession, Rivian won a further $500 million investment from a company you\\'d think would consider it a rival -- Ford -- and $350 million from privately held Cox Automotive. Those investments alone probably would have been enough to make Rivian a viable contender to Tesla, which has an SUV of its own on the market already (Model X), and announced an electric pickup truck offering in November (Cybertruck). But in the waning days of December, Rivian won an even bigger investment -- more money than Ford and Amazon ponied up, combined. On Monday, December 23, Rivian announced it had secured a $1.3 billion investment from \"funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.\" With that money in hand, Rivian ended the year with nearly $3 billion in new funding. Given that the company already has a production plant to build in (Mitsubishi\\'s old plant in Normal, Illinois), $3 billion should be just enough cash to develop the three closely related truck/van models revealed so far. According to autoblog.com, the average cost to develop new cars is about $1 billion per model. \\xa0 Of course, the question still remains: Will Rivian\\'s trucks sell? According to Wall Street Journal auto reporter Dan Neil, \"we are living through the S-curve of EV adoption,\" and 2020 could very well become the year of the electric \"car.\" That being said, there are going to be a lot of electric cars coming to market this year to choose from, with more than a dozen new models coming on line to compete with existing fare such as Tesla\\'s Models S, 3, and X and Nissan\\'s Leaf. \\xa0 Although it\\'s hard to keep track of all the moving parts, WSJ alone highlights Volvo\\'s XC40 Recharge, Ford\\'s Mustang Mach-E, and Mini\\'s Mini Cooper SE as viable contenders in addition to Tesla\\'s and Nissan\\'s wares. At starting prices ranging from $60,500 (Ford) to just $30,750 (Mini), each of these new rivals underprices Rivian\\'s offering. \\xa0 One thing Rivian has got, however, that everyone else has not: Last week, Rivian released a video demonstrating its new \"tank turn\" feature that will be available for both the R1T and R1S. Like a modern main battle tank, the truck\\'s four electric motors can spin in different directions, enabling the truck to literally turn on a dime -- spinning itself around a fixed point. \\xa0 Probably thought up as a way to market the truck to off-roaders initially, this feature would also make Rivian\\'s truck incredibly maneuverable in tight spaces, such as might be encountered on construction sites, in crowded driveways, and parking garages -- the latter perhaps a valuable selling point to suburban shoppers. Combined with the right software, I suspect Rivian\\'s tank-turn feature will also make parallel parking in even the tightest spaces a breeze. Long story short, yes, this truck will sell. Now, all Rivian needs to do is build it.  10 stocks we like better than\\xa0WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

The one analysts are watching heading into 2020 is Google Cloud.\\xa0Google\\'s \"other revenue\" that includes Google Cloud, Google Play, Google Home, and other hardware products has been Alphabet\\'s fastest-growing segment in the last few years, and it may reach 20% of the company\\'s total revenue in 2020.\\xa0 There are not many companies as forward-thinking as Alphabet that have the resources to invest billions in new growth avenues. The company considers its investments in moonshot opportunities, or \"other bets,\" as vital to its future success.\\xa0These other bets include potential world-changers, such as self-driving cars with Waymo, or growth opportunities in life sciences with Verily.\\xa0 Don\\'t let Alphabet\\'s $992 billion market cap make you think the stock has already run its course.\\xa0The company has more than doubled its revenue and earnings over the last five years,\\xa0and given its forward-thinking corporate culture, Alphabet should continue to grow for many years. Moving one spot below Google on Brand Finance\\'s most valuable brand list is Microsoft, at No. 4.\\xa0The software giant has been making essential tools for people to get stuff done for decades. Microsoft has over 900 million Windows 10 users.\\xa0Under CEO Sadya Nadella, the company has spread its reach well beyond the PC to mobile devices and the cloud. Microsoft has the brand recognition, network effect advantage, and resources to continue winning in the markets it serves. Its Office software is still in high demand after all these years. Even though Apple\\xa0has 1.4 billion users of its devices,\\xa0the familiarity people have with Apple\\'s software hasn\\'t dethroned Microsoft\\'s Word and Excel. Office commercial products, including 365 subscriptions, have been growing fast, up 25% year over year in the most recent quarter.\\xa0 Also, businesses are continuing to use cloud-based tools to handle IT services. The infrastructure-as-a-service cloud market is expected to grow three times faster than traditional IT services through 2022, according to Gartner.\\xa0Microsoft Azure has tremendous momentum in this space, with revenue surging 59% year over year in the last quarter.\\xa0 Microsoft has proven it can adapt its basic software services to the cloud and develop new cloud-based platforms for businesses, such as Dynamics 365 and Azure.\\xa0The ability to adapt to changing environments in technology gives me confidence that the company will still be around in 50 years. It offers good growth prospects, high margins,\\xa0and a growing stream of dividends. Owning the stock seems like a no-brainer for the 21st\\xa0century. Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Tesla is not short of investor attention. The stock has experienced a meteoric rise since its initial public offering in 2010, but the sky truly is the limit for Elon Musk\\'s company. Some on Wall Street are debating whether it\\'s time to sell the stock after the share price more than doubled off of its lows last year.\\xa0But I think long-term investors should stay the course, and if you don\\'t already own shares, you should consider starting a small position. Tesla is at the center of a secular trend sweeping the world, as alternative forms of energy are increasingly in demand for everything from how homes are built to what fuels our cars. Tesla is known for its Model S, Model X, and Model 3 electric vehicles, but it defines its mission as helping the world accelerate to sustainable energy through various energy products, including solar electricity.\\xa0The company has installed thousands of solar products for consumers since 2006, and last year, it released Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.\\xa0 You can\\'t underestimate a visionary leader like Musk, who has demonstrated a great talent for seeing an opportunity and starting a business to capture it.\\xa0As Tesla approaches a $100 billion market cap,\\xa0the company still has a tiny share of the nearly 100 million vehicles shipped in the industry every year.\\xa0There were about 367,500 Tesla vehicles delivered in 2019, for an increase of 50% year over year.\\xa0That growth is thanks to the Model 3, which went into production in 2017 and comes at a much more affordable price for the masses.\\xa0 However, Musk believes the upcoming Model Y will outsell the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined.\\xa0As Tesla releases more models, builds Gigafactories around the world,\\xa0increases scale, and brings prices down for these cars,\\xa0it\\'s inevitable the company will hit the one-million delivery mark at some point. There is enormous upside for the Tesla brand over the next 50 years. All three stocks are already large caps, but each could keep heading higher from here. Consider that\\xa0Coca-Cola\\xa0started in 1886,\\xa0but the stock is still increasing in value for shareholders.\\xa0Walt Disney\\xa0was started in 1923,\\xa0but the stock is up 355% over the last 10 years. Great growth stocks continue to find ways to deliver returns for shareholders, and I believe Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla will be no different.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Some need to put money into their retirement accounts before April 15. Others are trying to put their end-of-year bonuses or holiday gift money to work. But rushing to pick investments can lead to picking poor investments. The better strategy may be to work on developing a watch list of stocks even before you're ready to invest, so you'll be ready to buy one when the time is right. This month, stocks that you might want to keep an eye on without buying include companies facing uncertainty, such as U.S. oil stocks\\xa0ConocoPhillips\\xa0(NYSE: COP),\\xa0Chevron\\xa0(NYSE: CVX), and\\xa0ExxonMobil\\xa0(NYSE: XOM), as well as aircraft manufacturer\\xa0Boeing (NYSE: BA). Then there's a stock that might be too expensive to pick up right now -- electric carmaker\\xa0Tesla\\xa0(NASDAQ: TSLA).\\xa0\\xa0 Keeping an eye on top prospects can help you buy when the time is right. Image source: Getty Images. Oil prices ended 2019 with a sustained three-month rally that pushed them more than 10% above where they stood at the beginning of October. Many oil production stocks responded with rallies of their own. Shares of the largest independent U.S. exploration and production company,\\xa0ConocoPhillips, rose 14.1% in the fourth quarter. This month, though, has served up a heaping helping of uncertainty, thanks in part to the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Iran. After the U.S. assassination\\xa0of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, oil prices spiked briefly, with Brent crude briefly topping $70 a barrel. Prices have eased a bit in the days since, but the potential for volatility remains.\\xa0 Depending on how the situation unfolds, oil prices could go up...or down. The impact could be amplified for U.S. oil companies that do business in the Middle East, particularly ExxonMobil and Chevron, which have major Persian Gulf operations. ConocoPhillips, on the other hand, which has no Middle East oil presence,\\xa0could fare better in the event that the regional instability worsens. All energy investors should be keeping watch on this situation, but given the uncertainties, smart investors should probably just watch, and neither buy nor sell just yet. It's worth remembering that after the drone attack on one of Saudi Arabia's key oil facilities in September, oil prices spiked briefly, but quickly returned to their prior levels, leaving no lasting impact.\\xa0 Troubled aerospace giant Boeing closed out a rocky 2019 by firing its CEO. This month, it's hoping to make significant progress toward getting its grounded 737 MAX aircraft back in the air. Unfortunately, the timing on that is not up to Boeing, but various governments' regulatory agencies. In addition, Boeing needs to hammer out deals to compensate customers that have been impacted by fleet downtime and delivery delays.\\xa0 Working against Boeing are allegations that it was too cozy with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration during the initial review and testing phase of the new aircraft. That perception has put added pressure on regulators to take a harder-than-standard look at potential problems this time around. And in fact, according to\\xa0The New York Times, new potential design flaws have been uncovered in the wiring of the airplane's tail: an issue completely unrelated to the flaws in the MCAS system that caused the two deadly 737 MAX crashes, which resulted in the model's grounding. In good news for the company, it has reached agreements with several key customers including Southwest\\xa0and\\xa0American Airlines\\xa0regarding reimbursement for the revenue losses associated with the grounding of the fleet.\\xa0However, if the grounding drags on, or if more issues are uncovered, Boeing could be on the hook for more. Here's a stock price chart of four major automakers -- Ford, Toyota, General Motors, and\\xa0Tesla -- for the last three months:  TSLA data by YCharts Even if the chart didn't have the legend, you'd probably be able to guess that of those four companies, the blue line -- showing a stock price that's more than doubled -- belongs to Tesla. Its shares were buoyed as analysts reconsidered their stance on the potential for its unusual CyberTruck and the company's prospects in China. In the wake of that rise, Tesla's share price of about $466 is by far its highest ever, and its market cap of $84.1 billion is roughly equal to GM's and Ford's\\xa0combined.\\xa0 That said, investing is an endeavor for years and decades, not months, and the bigger picture matters. Step back a bit, and one sees that up until October, Tesla was actually having a very\\xa0bad\\xa02019.  TSLA data by YCharts So the big question for investors is, will this current rally continue? Or will the company's ongoing issues -- a lack of profitability, unfavorable product mix, and high debt load -- throw cold water on shareholders' hopes?\\xa0 When a company's share price performance has been this volatile, buying at the top can seem like a risky prospect. Yet investors will want to keep an eye on Tesla in case a more attractive entry point presents itself... and, historically speaking, that has tended to happen at least once every few months. Even if you need to make a big contribution to your tax-advantaged retirement account before April 15 rolls around, remember -- that's four months away. You don't need to rush to pick an investment right now. But developing a robust watch list of top stocks that you might want to buy under the right circumstances can help you make better decisions. This month, putting Tesla, Boeing, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, and ExxonMobil on your radar screen may be a better move than putting them directly into your portfolio.  10 stocks we like better than TeslaWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

When it comes to stock wins and losses, investors who did not sell the latter group will not have any capital losses to write off. But after the S&P 500 returned close to 30% in the year alone, meaning risks are higher than normal that 2020 will have at least one correction. The reasoning for a small correction is simple: Reversion to the mean is more likely. Investors need not panic about a potential market drop, but they may minimize the damage by following seven basic investing resolutions for 2020.  For fundamental investors, valuations matter in general. Microsoft (NASDAQ:) may sport a high price-to-earnings ratio, but that does not mean the stock will correct lower. Microsoft continues to report exceptionally strong software sales and growing cloud business. Subscription growth for Office 365 is unlikely to stall in 2020. So, MicrosoftÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s P/E of over 31 times is easily justified. GameStop (NYSE:) trades at just 0.6 times book and has a forward P/E just under 12. The stock is cheap, yet this does not imply the stock is a value holding. Digital game downloads from Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:) and from Steam are hurting game sales at GameStop. Whatever valuation investors choose, stick to a range that you find suitable and have the discipline to buy and sell. If, for example, Tesla (NASDAQ:) at a forward P/E of over 75 times understates its future growth, then continue holding the stock. Conversely, if you believe TeslaÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s capital cost requirements will grow so fast that the company will keep losing money, avoid the stock. The bottom line here is that Tesla is an example of a stock that enjoyed a solid rally in the second half of 2019. And if market indexes fall on profit-taking, selling pressure on Tesla may accelerate. Microsoft stock may dip, too, but investors may average down in the stock. That strategy would pay off if the market rebounds and if Microsoft continues to report strong subscription growth throughout 2020.  Looking at out-of-favor sectors will pay off if the undervaluation compensates investors for the risks in betting on an eventual recovery. The technology sector was one of many shining areas of the market in the last year. As it rose, markets ignored the rebound in oil prices. Chances are good thatÃ\\x82Â\\xa0the sector will rebound further in 2020. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:, NYSE:RDS.B) fell as low as $56 in the last few months but promptly rebounded back to $60. With the prospects of energy prices recovering with the support of stronger global growth, RDS is a stock to consider. It pays a dividend that yields over 6%. BP (NYSE:) is also trading in a narrow range and pays a dividend that yields 6.5%. The drug manufacturing sector is another beat-up sector that is out of favor. Teva Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:) is starting to win its investorsÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99 confidence. Management is stabilizing the business and applying much of its cash flow to pay down its debt. If the government allows for higher drug prices, TevaÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s revenue may stop falling. And if generic competition on TevaÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s Copaxone lessens, the stock could start at $10 as the bottom.    Avoiding stocks that reached all-time highs in the last year may work if markets really peaked at the end of 2019. If profit-taking picks up at the start of 2020, investors buying Apple (NASDAQ:) at all-time highs might face paper losses for a few years. In effect, investors are at the mercy of the markets trending higher. If that does not happen, and if Apple reports weak iPhone 11 sales, its stock may give up its 85% gains. Even though I said Microsoft is a buy based on its relative valuation, the stock also ran up to all-time highs recently. Investors are getting no margin of safety, especially when the stock is widely held in many mutual funds and index exchange-traded funds. Rite AidÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s (NYSE:) monstrous run-up to $24 is another example of a stock to avoid at the peak. With a short float of over 25%, a violent squeeze led to the stockÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s pop after its earnings report. Fundamentals of this drugstore chain improved in the last quarter, surprising short sellers. So, after the drop from the peak, investors may want to consider Rite Aid stock at better levels. A better idea would be to wait for Rite AidÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s next earnings report. If it posts improving same-store sales again, then the stock is a compelling investment.  Peter Lynch once said that if you canÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t explain why youÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99re investing in a company on a postcard, then donÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t invest in it. The biotechnology sector is fraught with danger for investors who do not understand the difference between drug discovery and drug sales. A drug discovery company has no revenue and applies all of its funded cash to research and development. Dermira (NASDAQ:) is an example of a company that reported positive clinical results for its atopic dermatitis research. Its shares nearly doubled from 52-week lows. XBiotech (NASDAQ:) also reported positive clinical data in the last few quarters. On Dec. 7, it sold its antibody discovery program to Janssen. Do you have the basic science background to follow clinical studies? Do you see a path to profitability for early-stage drug developers in the biotechnology space? If you do, then find and hold a basket of several drug stocks in this space for diversification. For everyone else, hold drug manufacturing stocks that generate consistently strong cash flow. I picked Ã\\x82Â\\xa0Regeneron (NASDAQ:) throughout 2019 for that reason. AbbVie (NYSE:), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:) are examples of stocks that are easier to understand. Of course, with Pfizer and AbbVie at all-time highs, investors might want to wait for a pullback.    In the last decade, buying Fitbit (NYSE:), GoPro (NASDAQ:) or Groupon (NASDAQ:) would have led to disastrous losses. These companies timed their stock listing at the peak of their respective hype. And when the fad ended, so did the marketÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s euphoria for their stock. For 2020, avoid fad stocks. Stocks that recently went public might happen to be fad stocks, with consumer demand for their products on the decline. Peloton (NASDAQ:) stock peaked at $36 in December 2019. Selling accelerated after a viral ad created a mixed but largely negative reaction. But fundamentals for Peloton could deteriorate if discretionary spending weakens in 2020. The Peloton exercise bike is a few thousand dollars and requires a monthly subscription. If owners cancel their service due to a lack of interest, PelotonÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s revenue growth would plunge. Canada Goose (NYSE:) is a potential fad company whose product is facing weakening demand. Still, Hong Kong is an important region for the winter jacket maker. The company forecast weak performance ahead due to the unrest. Lululemon (NASDAQ:) looked like a fad stock a few years ago but as its highs indicate, that is not true. Lululemon continues to report strong earnings every year.  Technology stocks were star sectors in the last year. Most of the high-flying stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Facebook (NASDAQ:) reinvested earnings back in the business or bought back stock. Yet if growth slows, investors end up holding underperforming shares. So, for 2020, investors should focus on holding stocks that pay dividends. Dividend-paying stocks distribute earnings to investors instead of retaining them. This gives investors a stream of regular dividend income. And it becomes a core source of returns should stocks move nowhere or head lower. Disney (NYSE:), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:) and AbbVie are some dividend-paying stocks to consider. They have an even balance of dividend yield and stock appreciation potential. The energy sector pays a richer dividend yield but due to its cyclical nature, it is riskier. If you happen to believe that the energy cycle is back to its growth phase, then Exxon (NYSE:) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:) are the big mega-capitalization names to look at in 2020.  Cable companies look stale and are operating in mature-phase markets. Newspapers, magazines and books are declining markets that investors should avoid. Dig deeper into companies that at first look like they are operating in a mature business. Then evaluate their overall growth potential as the business pivots. Comcast (NASDAQ:) is not just a boring cable company. It has an internet business that is growing nicely, an amusement park and NBC. The company is pivoting its business into the new-age sectors. Very recently, rumors surfaced that Comcast will buy a free streaming service called Xumo. This would fit nicely ahead of its launch of Peacock, a free streaming service. Comcast is dealing with the loss of traditional cable subscribers by looking at it from an NBC perspective. Big affiliate renewal deals will come up in 2021. Plus, Comcast is always looking at its contribution to profits. Even after rising by over 30% in the last year, Comcast trades at a forward P/E of 13.5 times. If its streaming business takes off, markets may reward the stock with a higher valuation. As of this writing, Chris Lau owns shares of BP. The post  appeared first on InvestorPlace.

Including the stock's intraday 6.4% gain as of 11:15 a.m. EST on Wednesday, shares are up more than 140% over the past four months. The stock's sharp gain on Wednesday follows yet another analyst's decision to increase his 12-month price target for the electric-car maker's stock ahead of earnings on Jan. 29. Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors on Wednesday that he believes the company's fourth-quarter earnings and its guidance for vehicle deliveries will not disappoint investors when Tesla reports results later this month. He believes there's robust demand for vehicles in China and Europe. Further, he is particularly bullish on the company's opportunity in China following the start of production at the company's Shanghai factory earlier this year.

That was evident in its recent announcement that it will provide investors with a massive dividend increase as well as keep buying back its stock. It\\'s now the company\\'s fourth dividend increase since launching its new strategy in late 2016. It likely won\\'t be the last, given the company\\'s focus on sending an increasing supply of its cash flow back to its investors. ConocoPhillips unveiled its 2020 capital return plans this week. The highlight was a monster 38% increase in its quarterly dividend. That will boost the yield up past 3%. That\\'s a much higher level than most of its upstream-focused peers, which typically offer yields of around 1%. Image source: Getty Images. This year\\'s raise is much larger than the company has typically provided its investors since it reset its dividend in early 2016. The company\\'s first increase from that reset level came a year later when it raised its payout by 6%. It followed that up with two more last year, boosting the payout by 7.5% in February and another 7% in December. With its latest raise, the dividend is now 68% above where it was in early 2016, though it\\'s still about 43% below its peak level in 2015. Driving ConocoPhillips\\' massive dividend increase is the \"significant transformation our company has undergone over the past few years,\" according to CEO Ryan Lance. He noted: \"Since announcing our returns-focused value proposition in 2016, we have improved our underlying performance drivers and lowered our sustaining price for the business. Given these enhancements, we are confident we can fund a higher, growing cash dividend, while maintaining a substantial, consistent buyback program.\" Speaking of share repurchases, ConocoPhillips also announced its intention to buy back another $3 billion in stock next year. On the one hand, that\\'s down from the $3.5 billion it plans to repurchase this year. However, the total cash return will remain the same, since the company\\'s increased dividend will cost it an additional $500 million next year. ConocoPhillips is one of several U.S. oil companies that have provided their investors with big-time dividend increases this year. Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD) has been among the leaders. The Permian Basin-focused oil company doubled its dividend in February as part of its plan to return more cash to investors. The company would go on to boost its payout again in August, this time by another 175%. With that latest increase, Pioneer\\'s dividend has grown by a jaw-dropping 2,100% since the company started boosting it in 2017. However, even with that big-time increase, Pioneer\\'s dividend yield is only 0.7%, which is well below the average of stocks in the S&P 500. EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), meanwhile, has also made it a priority to increase its payout. In May, the company boosted its dividend by 31%. Add that to the two increases it delivered in 2018, and EOG\\'s payout has jumped 72% in the past two years. That\\'s all part of the company\\'s plan to increase its dividend yield closer to the S&P 500\\'s average of 2%. With its payout currently around 1.6%, the company\\'s dividend still has more high-octane growth ahead. The reason a growing number of oil companies are making dividend growth a priority is that investors are growing tired of the oil sector\\'s chronic underperformance. Oil producers thought that production growth would fuel higher stock prices. Instead, all that excess output weighed on crude prices, which pushed down their stock market values. That failed strategy is leading a growing number of producers to allocate more cash to shareholder returns instead of to growth in hopes of creating more value for their investors. It\\'s an approach that worked well for ConocoPhillips last year, which is why the company and its peers are sticking with a strategy that\\'s delivering results. ConocoPhillips is working hard to win back dividend investors following its decision to reset the payout level in early 2016 to better cope with lower crude prices. With its latest raise, the company once again pays a well-above-average dividend. Meanwhile, given its priority of returning more cash to investors, the payout should continue growing in the coming years. That makes it a much more compelling option for income-focused investors to consider buying.  10 stocks we like better than ConocoPhillipsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The sector was once an excellent place for income-seeking investors to get above-average yields. However, when oil prices fell off their triple-digit perch a few years ago, it took many of the sector's dividends down with it. The industry has worked hard since that time to deal with its new reality of lower oil prices by cutting costs. These efforts have been paying dividends. That has allowed producers to begin sending more cash to their investors once again. And that means income-focused investors should start paying closer attention to this sector. Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy (NYSE: WPX) has been working hard over the past few years to reshape its business. The company sold several assets to reduce debt as well as finance its expansion program in the low-cost, oil-rich Permian Basin. Those moves were all part of a strategy to begin returning cash to its investors by 2021.  Last year was a pivotal one for the oil and gas company as it reached its debt reduction target. The company entered 2019 needing oil to average only about $50 a barrel to fund its expansion plan. However, thanks to higher oil prices, additional asset sales, excellent operating results, and a needle-moving acquisition, WPX Energy was able to accelerate its capital return program. It started by authorizing a $400 million share repurchase program in August. It has since initiated a quarterly dividend, which it will begin paying after closing its latest acquisition. While that payout's implied yield of 0.8% might not be all the appealing to income-seeking investors, WPX Energy should have the fuel to grow its dividend at a healthy rate in the coming years, which makes it more attractive.  Image source: Getty Images. WPX Energy is joining many of its peers in starting small. However, what these payouts have lacked in size, they've more than made up for with growth. Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG), for example, initiated a small dividend last year, which yielded around 0.5%. The company boosted that payout by 50% earlier this year and now yields about 0.9%. With Diamondback on track to generate a gusher of free cash in 2020 if oil remains at its current level, it will probably give its investors another sizable raise next year as well as buy back a big chunk of its stock.  Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD), meanwhile, had been paying its investors a paltry dividend for many years. However, the company started increasing it at a rapid pace in 2018. This year alone, Pioneer doubled its payout in February and then boosted it by another 175% in August. As a result, it has now increased its dividend by an eye-popping 2,100% in the last two years, driving its yield up to 1.2%. Oil giants ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG), likewise, have boosted their payouts at impressive rates. ConocoPhillips was one of several oil stocks that slashed its dividend as a result of crashing crude prices a few years ago. However, it has been growing at an accelerated rate in recent years. The company started with a 6% increase in 2016 and followed that up with two more last year -- 7.5% in February and another 7% in December -- before giving its investors a monster 38% raise this October. With that latest increase, ConocoPhillips now yields an above-average 2.7%. EOG Recourses, on the other hand, kept its payout flat during the darkest days of the oil market downturn. It has since restarted its dividend growth engine, giving its investors two raises last year and another 31% increase this year. As a result, it now yields about 1.5%. More high-octane growth, however, is up ahead, given that the company aims to push its yield up to at least the level of the S&P 500, which is around 2%. While most oil stocks don't pay high yields these days, many are growing their payouts at rapid rates. That's noteworthy, considering that dividend growth stocks have historically produced the highest total returns. That's why income investors might want to consider adding a dividend-paying oil stock to their portfolio since they could generate some high-octane total returns in the coming years as they keep increasing their payouts at a fast pace.  10 stocks we like better than ConocoPhillipsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, a number of outstanding companies announced far more substantial dividend increases - 20%, 30% or more. In a few cases, companies more than doubled their payouts overnight. Companies often authorize significant upgrades in their regular dividends to attract new investors or stand out from industry competitors. While one-time influxes of cash will often go toward buybacks or one-time special dividends, firms that believe they can maintain heightened levels of profitability will return some of that money through larger regular payouts. You\\'ll notice that many of the past year\\'s largest dividend increases came from the banking industry. That\\'s in part because some large banks that were sitting on stockpiles of cash received permission from government regulators to distribute their excess capital to investors. Another major impetus for dividend growth was tax reform, which bumped up after-tax profits for many American companies, including banks. Here, we look at 30 companies that stood out over the past year because of their outsize dividend increases. Each dividend growth stock listed here improved its regular payout by at least 20% in 2019, though in numerous cases, the dividend improved by considerably more. Let\\'s take a look.  Market value: $306.7 billion Dividend yield: 2.1% 2019 dividend increase: 20% Bank of America (BAC, $34.71) is America\\'s second largest money-center bank by market capitalization, behind only $426 billion JPMorgan Chase (JPM). BofA is tops, however, in market share of consumer deposits, and it also claims to be the country\\'s leading digital bank. Thanks to ready access to low-cost funding, Bank of America has been able to boost its earnings assets by double digits over the past few years while using less regulatory capital. The bank finished 2019 with a decent fourth quarter in which net income grew about 6% to 70 cents per share. It closed out the year with assets totaling $2.43 trillion and deposits of $1.43 trillion. Bank of America\\'s most recent dividend hike was announced in July\" a 20% improvement to a new quarterly rate of 18 cents per share. The cash distribution has exploded over the past five years by 260%, but it sprang from a lowly position. BofA\\'s dividend shrank from 64 cents in 2008 to a penny in 2009, and the company only restarted its dividend growth in 2014, when it jumped to 5 cents per share. A meager payout ratio of 24% (that is, 24% of BofA\\'s profits go toward paying the dividend) leaves a wide margin of safety and plenty of room for future dividend growth.  Market value: $1.1 billion Dividend yield: 1.9% 2019 dividend increase: 20% First Bancorp (FBNC, $38.39) is the fourth largest bank headquartered in North Carolina. Founded in 1935, this community bank has $6.1 billion in assets and approximately 100 branch locations across both Carolinas. The bank plans to expand its footprint in North Carolina\\'s most populous markets, which include Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Raleigh and Charlotte, while upgrading its technology. Last year, First Bancorp launched new bill pay systems, mortgage-driven loan apps and call centers. In 2020, the bank plans to introduce new credit card lending and retail banking platforms. Reflecting the strength of its Carolina metro markets, First Bancorp has generated roughly 34% annual earnings growth over the past half-decade, and it has consistently beaten analyst consensus EPS estimates every quarter since 2015. First Bancorp announced two dividend hikes in 2019 - though only one, a 20% increase to 12 cents per share, took effect last year. The second announcement, made at the end of December, was a much more significant enhancement to 18 cents per share, or a 50% hike. That surely will rank among 2020\\'s largest dividend increases. Like BofA, a meager payout ratio (23%) gives the company ample room to keep hiking its payouts.  Market value: $11.4 billion Dividend yield: 1.5% 2019 dividend increase: 20% Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII, $277.81) was one of 16 companies awarded huge contracts by the Defense Intelligence Agency in September for analytical and operational support services. The multiyear contract has a five-year base period and a potential value of $17 billion. That news sparked short-term optimism in the stock and was one of several drivers of the company\\'s 32% market-beating gains last year. Huntington Ingalls delivered more good news when it reported its September quarter, including 7% revenue growth due to acquisitions and higher production volume at its Newport News ship-building yard. Contract backlog at the end of September was $39.2 billion, up 70% from year-end 2018. HII also generated $250 million of free cash flow, $103 million of which was distributed to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Earnings per share declined by 29% due mainly to accounting adjustments and higher pension costs, but its profits still were higher than consensus analyst estimates. A couple days prior to reporting these results, Huntington Ingalls announced a 20% bump in its payout to $1.03 per share. It also announced a $1 billion increase to its share repurchase program, and extended the timeline of that plan from Oct. 31, 2022, to Oct. 31, 2024. The company\\'s payout ratio is a prudent 24%, and it has been a generous dividend growth stock, averaging 39% raises annually over the past half-decade.  Market value: $5.9 billion Dividend yield: 3.0% 2019 dividend increase: 20% Synovus Financial (SNV, $40.00) became the Southeast\\'s fifth largest bank last year by acquiring Florida Community Bank. Today, the bank has $48 billion of assets and a network of roughly 300 branches across Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida. The merger expanded Synovus\\' presence in fast-growing areas of Florida that now represent one-third of its franchise. In addition, the company broadened its wealth management and brokerage capabilities, gained new cross-selling opportunities and leveraged its technology investment across a broader footprint. Synovus has produced 22% annual EPS growth over the past five years and regularly outperforms regional peers on profit metrics such as net interest margin (NIM), return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Its robust financial growth has been redistributed to shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend that has expanded by well more than 24% annually. That includes a 20% hike announced in mid-January 2019. A payout ratio of 34% implies a safe dividend with flexibility to grow.  Market value: $282.8 billion Dividend yield: 1.5% 2019 dividend increase: 20% UnitedHealth Group (UNH, $298.47) is the American market leader in managed health-care plans and benefits. The company provides health-care coverage and related services to more than 137 million individuals and is one of the nation\\'s largest providers of Medicare Advantage plans. Through its OptumHealth business, the company also offers technology-enabled health services, including prescription drug services. UnitedHealth has been a marvel of predictability, delivering 11% sales growth and roughly 14% EPS growth annually over the past decade. That included a 7% improvement on the top line and a 17% boost to the bottom line in 2019. The result: $18.5 billion in cash flows from operations across the year. And thanks to strong recurring revenues, UNH has high earnings visibility. It\\'s guiding for high-single-digit sales and profit growth in 2020. UnitedHealth has raised its dividend by 20% for three consecutive years, and the payout has been on the rise annually since 2010.  Market value: $454.9 billion Dividend yield: 0.6% 2019 dividend increase: 20% Visa (V, $204.70) is the world leader in digital payments. During its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2019, the company processed 138.3 billion payments for 15,500 financial institution clients. Visa\\'s total payments and cash volume grew to $11.6 trillion, and more than 3.4 billion Visa cards were available for use worldwide and accepted at more than 61 million merchant locations. The company see growth opportunities in its core credit, debit and pre-paid card products as a result of $17 trillion in consumer spending and $15 billion to $20 billion of business-to-business (B2B) spending still done in cash and checks. Visa also plans to accelerate its migration into digital payments with new products for B2B, person-to-person (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C) and government-to-consumer (G2C) payments. Visa\\'s revenues improved by 11% in fiscal 2019, fueling a 20% rise in EPS. That came as a result of new client partnerships, organic investments and acquisitions. Recent M&A activity included a cross-border payment processor (Earthport) and a point-of-sale payment software developer (Payworks). Visa is guiding for low double-digit 2020 revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth. Visa is gaining a reputation among dividend growth stocks. Its 20% dividend hike in 2019 was right in line with its five-year average and marked the company\\'s 11th consecutive improvement. A modest payout ratio of 19% should enable the company to keep the pedal down.  Market value: $885.8 million Dividend yield: 3.4% 2019 dividend increase: 21% Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp. (AGM, $82.70), also known as \"Farmer Mac,\" lends to farmers and ranchers across rural America. The company offers loans secured by first liens on agricultural real estate, agricultural and rural development loans secured by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as loans that help cooperatives finance rural telecom and electric systems. Over the past decade, Farmer Mac\\'s loan volume has grown by nearly 11% annually. Despite robust loan growth, Farmer Mac holds only a 6% share of the expanding $245 billion agricultural credit market. Significant market growth is expected as a result of rising worldwide food demand; to feed the world\\'s growing population, American farm productivity must double over the next 30 years. Farmer Mac plans to leverage its lower cost of funds - a major competitive advantage - to gain market share. Farmer Mac\\'s profit growth has been much more modest than the previous companies on this list, at about 7.5% annually. Still, it has been able to afford robust dividend increases of about 38% annually over the past half-decade; last year\\'s hike came to 21%. Despite that, AGM shares boast a modest payout ratio of just 34% of the company\\'s profits.  Market value: $66.4 billion Dividend yield: 3.0% 2019 dividend increase: 21% PNC Financial Services (PNC, $153.36) provides retail banking services to more than 8 million retail customers across the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. Its digital footprint is built around its well-known \"Virtual Wallet\" product. The company also offers corporate banking to clients that include two-thirds of the Fortune 500 companies, and its asset management business oversees just less than $300 billion in assets. PNC also owns a minority stake in BlackRock (BLK), one of the world\\'s largest investment management firms. 2019 was a relatively slow year for the company, however. Revenues improved by just 4%, while net income ticked just 1.3% higher. The company\\'s fourth-quarter earnings managed to top estimates, though Wall Street knocked shares lower on worries about increasing costs. Still, PNC has delivered 3.5% annual growth in assets, 5% yearly EPS growth and nearly 6% gains in book value per share. But the company is sharing increasing amounts of its wealth to shareholders. PNC announced a $1 billion increase to its share-buyback plan, through the end of Q2 2020. It also announced a 21% dividend hike in July to $1.15 per share - a little higher than its 19% five-year annual average.  Market value: $128.6 billion Dividend yield: 2.1% 2019 dividend increase: 21% Union Pacific (UNP, $185.32) operates the Union Pacific Railroad - a rail network connecting 23 states in the western U.S. Its rail system serves many of the fastest-growing American population centers, as well as all of the major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports and eastern gateways. It also connects with Canada\\'s rail systems, and it\\'s the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. Moreover, UNP provides rail freight services for more than 10,000 customers primarily involved in the agricultural, energy and manufacturing industries. The trade war with China negatively impacted the company\\'s September quarter results, leading to a 7% year-over-year decline in freight volume. That said, EPS still improved by 3% thanks to operating efficiencies and $1.1 billion worth of share repurchases during the quarter. Union Pacific did guide for a 10% volume decline in the December quarter, however, which caused analysts to reduce consensus 2019 EPS estimates. (The company\\'s Q4 results are due out Jan. 23.) Recent trade war issues have interrupted an otherwise excellent past performance which had Union Pacific generating 14% yearly EPS gains over the past decade. The company has also been a consistent dividend growth stock; its payouts have improved for 13 years in a row, including at 14% annual clip over the past five years. UNP offered up a pair of hikes in 2019 - first from 80 cents per share to 88 cents in March, then again to 97 cents in September, which was good for a total jump of about 21%.  Market value: $9.3 billion Dividend yield: 1.2% 2019 dividend increase: 25% Carlisle Companies (CSL, $163.95) owns a portfolio of niche brands and businesses that manufacture highly engineered products for the roofing, aerospace, medical, defense, transportation, industrial, agriculture, mining and construction industries. The company delivered a stellar September quarter performance, with sales up 8% year-over-year, its 26th consecutive quarter of sales growth. EPS from continuous operations rocketed 52%. Carlisle benefited from price increases, cost savings and acquisitions in its construction materials business, and a favorable sales mix in its interconnect technologies segment. This reliable performer has delivered 9% annual sales growth and 10% yearly EPS gains over the past five years. Carlisle is a spectacular dividend growth stock, too, boasting 42 consecutive annual increases. Last August, it bolstered its payout by 25%, to 50 cents per share.  Market value: $301.7 million Dividend yield: 3.9% 2019 dividend increase: 25% First Choice Bancorp (FCBP, $25.88) is a Southern California community bank with nine branches and two loan production offices serving Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties. The bank was founded in 2005 and has $1.7 billion in assets. It evolved from being primarily a lender to the Asian-American community to become a more mainstream bank. Since 2014, First Choice has generated 22% yearly loan growth and 21% deposit growth. Assets exploded by 60% in 2018, when it acquired rival Pacific Commerce Bancorp. The merger also enabled FCBP to improve efficiencies via increased scale. Its profits per share have swelled by 28% annually over the past three years, including a 17% improvement during the September quarter. First choice\\'s near-term priorities are deepening its presence in Southern California markets and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. It worked toward that latter goal in November, announcing a 25% dividend increase to 25 cents per share - its first payout hike in four years.  Market value: $650.1 million Dividend yield: 1.1% 2019 dividend increase: 25% MGP Ingredients (MGPI, $38.18) is a major supplier of distilled spirits to branded liquor producers, and also produces specialty wheat proteins and starches. Although not a name familiar to many consumers, MGP is a leading supplier of premium bourbon, rye whiskies, distilled gin and vodkas. The company has turned around from a $4.9 million loss in 2013 to a $37.3 million profit in 2019 thanks to MGP\\'s focus on premium liquors, whiskey\\'s rising share of the spirits market, and margin gains from a better product mix. The company\\'s sales of premium alcoholic beverages have grown from 57% of overall sales four years ago to 70% today. In addition to distilled spirits, MGP supplies specialty wheat proteins and starches used in meat substitute products and is well-positioned to benefit from growth in this market to $5.2 billion in 2020. That said, the company\\'s shares recently plunged by almost 28% in a single day recently after it announced considerably weaker preliminary full-year 2019 results than Wall Street was expecting. CEO Gus Griffin said the lackluster guidance was a \"result of us ultimately being unsuccessful in transacting a large portion of the aged whiskey sales we had forecast for the fourth quarter,\" implying the issue wasn\\'t demand, but MGP\\'s ability to execute and capture that demand. As for the dividend: MGP actually doubled its quarterly payout in 2018, from 4 cents per share to 8 cents per share, then followed that up with a 25% hike in 2019, to a dime. Its payout ratio of 17% provides plenty of runway for future dividend growth.  Market value: $19.7 billion Dividend yield: 1.1% 2019 dividend increase: 29% CDW Corp. (CDW, $136.85) is an IT solutions provider to more than 250,000 business, government, education and health-care customers in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. It offers cloud computing, collaboration, security, mobility and data center optimization solutions across 100,000 products sourced from 1,000 business partners. A testimony to just how fractured the IT market is: Despite being a market leader, CDW holds just 5% of the $325 billion opportunity. Growth will come from adding new customers, enhancing capabilities in high-growth solutions areas and expanding service offerings. CDW\\'s sales rose 11% during the first nine months of 2019, fueling a 13% improvement in adjusted earnings per share. The company is guiding for mid-teen EPS gains for the full year, and expects to exceed its internal goal of growing 200 to 300 basis points faster than the overall American IT market. Less trumpeted, but still appreciated, is CDW\\'s flourishing dividend. That payout has skyrocketed by 462% since 2015, including a 29% hike in 2019, to 38 cents per share, following a 40% improvement in 2018. CDW\\'s goal is to maintain a payout ratio of roughly 25%, with the dividend growing as profits do.  Market value: $326.5 billion Dividend yield: 0.5% 2019 dividend increase: 32% Mastercard (MA, $323.65), Visa\\'s chief rival, is another global titan in digital payments. The company\\'s operations span more than 210 countries and territories, and it has processed nearly 79 billion transactions across the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2019. Purchase volume over that time grew from $3.5 trillion, from $3.2 trillion in the year-ago nine-month period, and the company boasted 2.6 billion Mastercard- and Maestro-branded cards worldwide. Mastercard targets many of the same opportunities that Visa does - its plans for the future include building more into B2B, cross-border B2B and P2P, real-time payments and applications, cyber solutions and data analytics. The company grew revenues by 15% year-over-year during its third quarter, and profits by 21%. Worldwide, its gross dollar volume (GDV) climbed 14% to $1.65 trillion - U.S. growth was 12%, but 16% across the rest of the world. Mastercard has been growing both its dividends and share repurchases over the past few years. As of August 2019, MA shareholders had reaped $6 billion from the company via dividends and buybacks - as much as it had spent across all of 2018. The payout grew by 32% in 2019, to 33 cents per share. Mastercard also cleared the 20% bar with its 2020 hike, announced Jan. 28, to 40 cents per share - a 21% improvement.  Market value: $17.8 billion Dividend yield: 3.5% 2019 dividend increase: 33% Citizens Financial Group (CFG, $40.87) offers retail and commercial banking services through approximately 1,100 branches in 11 states across the Mid-Atlantic, New England and Midwest regions. Headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, the bank had $165.7 billion of assets under management as of the end of 2019. Citizens finished out 2019 with a record fourth quarter for noninterest income, which grew 17% year-over-year on the back of strong mortgage banking, as well as record results from its capital markets, foreign exchange and interest-rate products. For the full year, net income grew by just 2%, to $1.7 billion, though EPS jumped by 8%, to $3.81, thanks to significant share repurchases. The company\\'s \"Citizens Access\" digital platform ended 2019 with deposits of $5.8 billion. Mortgage banking fees surged by 45%, while trust and investment services fees grew by 21%. The company\\'s efficiency initiatives also bore fruit, with the \"Top 5\" program achieving $125 million in pre-tax run-rate benefits in 2019. Its \"top 6\" program is expected to generate between $300 million and $325 million in pre-tax run-rate benefits by the end of 2021. CFG has been among the more aggressive dividend growth stocks of late. It offered up a pair of dividend increases in 2019: an 18.5% increase in January, to 32 cents per share, and a 12.5% bump in July to 36 cents. It\\'s similar to 2018, when Citizens boosted dividends by 22% in January and 23% in July.  Market value: $619.4 million Dividend yield: 1.0% 2019 dividend increase: 33% Independence Holding (IHC, $41.71) underwrites specialty health and disability insurance through its Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American insurance subsidiaries. The company also provides short-term disability and family leave policies for small employers, long-term disability insurance for school districts and municipalities, and specialty health and pet insurance. This company goes through cycles, so revenues and profits tend to ebb and flow. Independence\\'s pre-tax income rose 11% in the September quarter, but EPS declined year-over-year due to reduced tax benefits. The company plans to step up investment in its tech infrastructure to support growth in its pet insurance business and Medicare supplement businesses. The pet insurance market is growing nearly 20% annually; meanwhile, 10,000 new seniors age into the Medicare supplement insurance market every day. Independence also boasts an AA-rated investment portfolio, no debt and substantial free cash flow that totaled $31.7 last year - more than eight times what it paid out in dividends. IHC\\'s semiannual dividend grew by 33% in 2019 - that follows a 50% bump in 2018, and a 67% increase in 2017.  Market value: $7.9 billion Dividend yield: 0.9% 2019 dividend increase: 33% Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR, $181.61) develops and markets high-performance semiconductors used in computer, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer product applications. The company\\'s largest end-market, consumer products, represents nearly one-third of sales; those semiconductors are used in set-top boxes, monitors, home appliances, televisions and other consumer products. Monolithic Power Systems\\' profits have been steadily but forcefully expanding by about 36% annually over the past five years, fueled by rising demand in its computer, automotive, industrial and communications business lines. The company plans to grow by building market share in the cloud computing, automotive and telecom markets. During this year\\'s September quarter, sales improved by 8% and adjusted EPS rose 3%. MPWR is a relatively new dividend payer, having initiated payouts in 2015. Its dividend growth is new, too - distributions were stuck at 20 cents per share quarterly for the first few years, but jumped to 30 cents per share in 2018, then another 33% last year, to 40 cents.  Market value: $12.2 billion Dividend yield: 4.0% 2019 dividend increase: 39% Leading North American brewer Molson Coors Brewing (TAP, $56.57) has been in a downward trend for roughly three years and lost more than 40% of its value in the process. That slump continued in October, after the company reported September-quarter revenue and earnings misses. The weak results were mainly due to volume declines, which the company hopes to offset with increased efficiencies and stepped-up investing in its better-performing brands. Molson Coors plans to invest more in premium brands such as Blue Moon, Belgian Moon in Canada and Peroni, and expand into new beverage categories such as ciders, wine spritzers and cannabis-infused beverages. The company took one step in that direction in November, announcing a partnership with L.A. Libations, which specializes in emerging non-alcoholic beverages. At the same time, the company plans to save $600 million over the next three years by consolidating its four business units into two. To spark some interest in its lackluster shares, Molson Coors announced its first dividend increase in years - a 39% hike to 57 cents per share. The company expects 2020 to be a transition year marked by flat to low-single-digit growth, but the new higher dividend doesn\\'t appear in danger given a moderate 53% payout ratio.  Market value: $156.5 million Dividend yield: 1.6% 2019 dividend increase: 40% Prudential Bancorp (PBIP, $17.61) is the holding company for Prudential Bank. The Philadelphia-headquartered bank was founded in 1886 and today operates eight branches in its hometown, as well as loan production offices in Huntingdon Valley and Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. The bank has nearly $1.3 billion in assets. PBIP recently reported its second straight year of record financial performance, with assets up 19% year-over-year for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2019, and earnings per share surging by 40%. Some of that growth has come on the back of acquisitions; the 2017 purchase of rival Polonia Bancorp added $285 million (more than 50%) to the bank\\'s asset base. Management attributed strong 2019 results to big gains in interest-earning assets and good expense management, but warned of margin compression due to interest-rate issues. Prudential Bancorp\\'s dividend has improved a few times over the past few years, but it\\'s not a serial raiser. Nonetheless, investors celebrated a 40% hike in the payout, announced in December, to 7 cents per share. The bank also has issued special dividends in three of the past four years, including 2019. Its 45-cent one-time distribution was thrice the 15 cents it paid in 2018.  Market value: $4.9 billion Dividend yield: 2.2% 2019 dividend increase: 41% Best known for its made-to-order burgers, Wendy\\'s (WEN, $21.69) operates more than 6,700 company-owned and franchised fast-food restaurants worldwide and is the world\\'s third largest quick-service restaurant chain. During the September quarter, Wendy\\'s opened 40 new restaurants, bringing the total number of new restaurants opened in 2019 to 111. System-wide sales improved nearly 6% and adjusted EPS rose 12%. A cornerstone of the company\\'s growth strategy is its \"1 More Visit, 1 More Dollar\" initiative, which seeks to increase same-store sales by launching new menu items. Going forward, Wendy\\'s is aiming for 4% to 5% annual system-wide sales growth, high-single-digit free cash flow growth and a dividend payout ratio of roughly 50%. Wendy\\'s has been enhancing the annual sum of its quarterly payout for 10 consecutive years, and it delivered two dividend increases in 2019. First, it announced an 18% upgrade in February, to 10 cents per share, then another 20% hike in October to 12 cents. That amounts to a 41% improvement across the year. That said, its payout ratio is now a hefty 80% of earnings. That doesn\\'t mean Wendy\\'s dividend won\\'t improve in future years, but it does indicate the pace of dividend growth might be muted.  Market value: $1.8 billion Dividend yield: 0.8% 2019 dividend increase: 50% Dillard\\'s (DDS, $71.57) is a department store operating primarily in the Southern and Midwestern U.S. The company operates 259 Dillard\\'s stores and 30 discount centers spanning 29 states. Total store selling space is estimated at 48.9 million square feet. Despite retail\\'s well-known woes over the past few years, Dillard\\'s shares have at least been holding up, notching 24% gains over the past few years - nothing to scream about, but far better than the likes of JCPenney (JCP) and Sears Holdings (SHLDQ). The company\\'s September-quarter results were hardly encouraging, however. While retail margins improved and revenues and profits beat analyst estimates, comparable-store sales (stores open for at least 12 months) were flat and profits per share fell by nearly 19%. Still, free cash flow over the trailing 12 months is 52% better than the year-ago period, reflecting the benefits of Dillard\\'s improved inventory management.  Market value: $68.5 million Dividend yield: 1.1% 2019 dividend increase: 50% First US Bancshares (FUSB, $11.00) is a small but fast-growing commercial lender providing services through 20 branch offices across Alabama, Tennessee and Virginia. The bank also offers consumer lending through its ALC (Acceptance Loan Company) subsidiary, which has 21 offices across 11 states, and reinsurance through its FUSB Reinsurance segment. The bank currently boasts about $772 million in assets. The acquisition of a competitor (The People\\'s Bank) in 2018 added $155 million to First US Bancshares\\' earnings assets and gave it a presence in the fast-growing Knoxville market. The company has identified 18 cities across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee as targets for branch expansion, and it recently opened new loan production offices in Mobile, Alabama and Chattanooga, Tennessee. The bank\\'s EPS shot 227% higher during the first nine months of 2019 as a result of earnings asset growth and merger-related efficiencies of scale. FUSB\\'s earnings have been something of a roller coaster over the past few half-decade, but they\\'re at least pointed in the right direction now. First US Bancshares had been lifeless on the dividend front, stuck at 2 cents per share quarterly for years. That changed in late November 2019, when the company announced a 50% bump to 3 cents per share.  Market value: $1.3 billion Dividend yield: 3.9% 2019 dividend increase: 51% Medifast (MED, $115.58) manufactures and distributes weight-loss and wellness products and programs, mostly sold under its Optavia brand. The company differentiates its products from other weight-loss brands with clinical studies that have often led to physician recommendations. A network of 32,200 active coaches sold Medifast products during the September quarter; sales averaged $5,715 per coach - down 1% year-over-year. That said, sales exploded by 37% in the quarter, and EPS improved by 16%. Despite this strong quarter, the company significantly lowered its full-year outlook. It lowered its previous guidance, for $730 million to $750 million in sales and $6.75 to $6.95 in EPS, to $700 million to $710 million in sales and $5.80 to $5.90 in EPS. The company expects future growth will come from new products, more coaches, a bigger U.S. footprint and Asia-Pacific expansion. Medifast recently began selling products in Hong Kong and Singapore. Medifast has been churning out impressive dividend growth over the past few years: a 50% increase in 2017, 56% in 2018 and 51% in 2019, to its current payout of $1.13 per share. However, MED\\'s payout ratio is now 77% of this year\\'s expected profits, which means similar dividend growth will really only be possible on the back of significant earnings expansion. The good news there? Analysts are forecasting a 29% jump in the bottom line in 2020.  Market value: $88.3 billion Dividend yield: 2.0% 2019 dividend increase: 56% Financial advisory firm Goldman Sachs (GS, $249.46) was ranked tops in announced and completed mergers-and-acquisitions deals in 2019, according to Dealogic, as well as No. 1 in equity and equity-related offerings. The company derives 40% of revenues from trading, 25% from asset management, 21% from investment banking and 14% from consumer and wealth management. The firm\\'s revenues were flat in 2019, at $36.5 billion, but higher expenses and provision for credit losses weighed on EPS, which declined 17% year-over-year. Its quarterly profits have missed expectations twice in a row, too. That said, Goldman\\'s fourth-quarter revenues were strong, with rebounds in asset management and trading driving a 23% jump in the top line. Goldman Sachs purchased assets being sold at bargain prices by troubled rival Deutsche Bank (DB) in 2019, including an Asian portfolio of equity derivatives valued at $50 billion in September. These asset purchases are helping the bank expand market share. Goldman\\'s 56% payout bump in 2019 came across a pair of dividend increases: A more modest improvement, from 80 cents per share to 85 cents, announced in April, then a 47% burst to $1.25 announced in July. Even after that considerable hike, GS still pays out less than 20% of its profits as dividends.  Market value: $16.0 billion Dividend yield: 0.8% 2019 dividend increase: 56% SS&C Technologies (SSNC, $63.47) provides financial software to more than 18,000 clients worldwide. The company is transitioning from a software seller to a software-enabled service business that can generate higher margins and more recurring revenues. The benefits of this shift were evidenced by the company\\'s 96.4% revenue retention rate in the September quarter and 18% adjusted EPS gains. Operating cash flow surged by 134% during the first nine months of 2019 - a boon that enabled SS&C to pay down debt while continuing to make acquisitions. That\\'s good, because much of its growth - adjusted EPS have improved by 27% annually since its 2010 initial public offering - has come via M&A. The company closed more than $8 billion in purchase transactions in 2018 alone. SS&C is handing more of that cash over to shareholders, too. The company boosted its quarterly dividend by 25% to start 2019, then announced another 25% hike in November, to 12.5 cents per share - a total 56% increase across the year. Like many of these dividend growth stocks, SSNC boasts a still-modest payout ratio of 28%.  Market value: $31.9 billion Dividend yield: 1.1% 2019 dividend increase: 67% Toronto-based Barrick Gold (GOLD, $17.95) is one of the world\\'s largest gold producers. After merging with Randgold Resources last year, the company owns five of the industry\\'s top 10 gold assets and two development-stage assets with the potential to become top 10 gold producers. Barrick\\'s operations are expansive, across 15 countries, but most of its actual production comes from low-risk North American mines. The company\\'s preliminary full-year and fourth-quarter results indicate that Barrick has hit its full-year guidance targets for production. Barrick\\'s preliminary figure for gold production was 5.5 million ounces, versus an expected range of 5.1 million to 5.6 million ounces. Preliminary copper production of 432 million pounds, if it holds, would exceed guidance of 375 million to 430 million pounds. The company is shedding some of the assets it acquired with Randgold. Barrick and its Senegalese joint venture partner recently agreed to sell their 90% stake in a Senegal gold mine, for up to $430 million. This follows the sale of its 50% stake in the Kalgoorlie Super Pit, one of Australia\\'s largest gold mines, for $750 million a month earlier. Barrick Gold was targeting $1.5 billion of assets sales in 2019 and plans to use some of the proceeds to expand its footprint in copper mining. Demand for copper is rising due to the use of this metal in low-carbon technologies. Barrick Gold closed out 2018 by issuing an \"enhanced\" 7-cent-per-share dividend in connection with the Randgold merger (it had paid 3 cents quarterly since the start of 2017). However, its regular payout improved to 4 cents per share starting in 2019, then again to 5 cents later in the year. That represents a 67% improvement from its regular dole from 2018.  Market value: $10.0 billion Dividend yield: 0.2% 2019 dividend increase: 67% Universal Display (OLED, $212.85) develops and commercializes organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials used in smartphones and TVs. Its customers include electronics manufacturers such as Apple (AAPL), LG Display (LPL), BOE Technology, Sharp (SHCAY) and Pioneer. Universal Display holds more than 5,000 patents on its technologies and serves customers from offices in the US, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Ireland. Results have been choppy over the past few years, but generally pointed in the right direction. Revenues have grown roughly 11% per year through the end of 2018; profits have dropped from $1.59 per share to $1.24 per share in that same time frame, but analysts are expecting a $3.10 profit for full-year 2019. New product launches helped Universal Display deliver 71% sales growth and 184% EPS gains during the first nine months of 2019. Universal Display is a perfect example of the massive dividend increases that often come shortly after a company initiates payouts. The company began distributing a 3-cent-per-share dividend in 2017, doubled it in 2018, then hiked the payment another 67% in 2019 to a dime per share. Low 13% payout, the company\\'s minimal debt and big cash reserves provide a wide margin for dividend safety.  Market value: $4.0 billion Dividend yield: 0.5% 2019 dividend increase: 122% UniFirst (UNF, $211.82) supplies workplace uniforms and protective clothing to more than 300,000 customers, and it outfits nearly 2 million workers every business day. Workplace uniforms are a highly concentrated market, with just four companies (including Unifirst) representing more than 40% of industry volume. Growth in the uniform market has been robust at twice the rate of GDP. The company\\'s solid share of a growing uniform market has fueled roughly 5% annual revenue and EPS gains over the past half-decade, and results that have exceeded analyst estimates in nine of the past 10 quarters. Unifirst\\'s EPS rose by almost 14% in the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2019, on 7% sales growth. The company is guiding for at least 3% sales growth in fiscal 2020, but lower EPS mostly due to the fiscal year being one week shorter than 2019. Unifirst has ramped up its dividend like a company possessed over the past few years. It announced a tripling of its dividend in 2018, to 11.25 cents per share, then followed that up with a 122% hike announced in October 2019, to 25 cents per share. The outlook for more dividend growth is supported by modest 12% payout, low debt of $45.6 million and cash totaling $356 million.  Market value: $1.0 billion Dividend yield: 4.9% 2019 dividend increase: 186% Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR, $82.50) is a rare bird in the real estate world. This real estate investment trust (REIT) acquires, owns and manages specialized industrial properties that are leased to licensed operators of medical cannabis facilities. The company owns a portfolio of 41 properties across 13 states. Its properties are 100% leased and have average remaining lease terms of 15.5 years. Through the first nine months of 2019, the company had acquired 30 properties across nine states and entered into leasing agreements with 12 new operators. Purchase costs for these properties totaled $106.9 million. To raise capital for more property acquisitions, Innovative Industrial Properties recently issued $134.1 million of exchangeable senior notes and completed a $162.8 million share offering. Diluting shares like that has consequences - the secondary offering triggered an 18% decline in IIPR\\'s shares in July, and the stock lost more than half its value between then and late October. Still, Innovative Industrial Properties has been explosive by any standard, but especially compared to other REITs. Its stock has delivered a total return (price plus dividends) of 379% over the past three years, versus just 29% for the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ). The REIT continues to grow by leaps and bounds, announcing 171% revenue growth during the first nine months of 2019. Adjusted funds from operations (FFO, a measure of profitability for real estate companies) blossomed by 117% on a per-share basis. That has helped shares rebound somewhat off its October lows. IIPR\\'s biggest fireworks in 2019, however, came courtesy of its rapidly climbing payout. The REIT delivered four dividend increases across the year, climbing from 2018\\'s 35 cents per share to $1 per share by 2019\\'s end - a total improvement of 186%.  Market value: $24.6 billion Dividend yield: 1.2% 2019 dividend increase: 450% Boosted semiannual from 16 cents to 32 cents, then boosted to a quarterly 44 cents. Ends up being 450%. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD, $148.79) - a major oil producer in the Permian Basin, America\\'s most prolific shale oil play - delivered a pair of explosive dividend increases in 2019, with an additional twist. The company had doled out a 4-cent-per-share semiannual dividend for years since 2009, when it was forced to cut its payout amid the Great Recession. But that changed in 2018, as PXD quadrupled its dividend, to 16 cents per share. Pioneer then doubled that dole in March 2019, to 32 cents per share, and followed that up by not just raising its regular payout to 44 cents in September, but switching its payout plan from semiannually to quarterly. That projects out to $1.76 per share every year, up from 32 cents last year - a whopping 450% improvement. As for the company itself: It became a pure play in the Permian Basin last year by selling its Eagle Ford shale assets. It sold its remaining Eagle Ford assets in May of last year, for about $475 million, leaving it with roughly 680,000 net acres in the Midland Basin. Pioneer has taken advantage of its improved capital efficiency, $100 million of restructuring-related cost savings, and robust cash to boost shareholder returns through share repurchases and dividend growth. In addition to its generous dividend hikes, the company repurchased $728 million shares during the first nine months of 2019 as part of its $2 billion repurchase plan.

This gusher has overwhelmed the region\\'s infrastructure, which pushed down prices. Natural gas has been especially hard hit, with prices at two regional hubs falling into negative territory earlier this year. Because of that, many producers chose to flare their natural gas output as opposed to selling it at a loss. At one point, they were burning off enough gas to power every home in the state of Texas.  Pipeline companies like Kinder Morgan\\xa0(NYSE: KMI), however, have been racing to solve this problem by building new infrastructure. The company recently brought the much-needed Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (GCX) online slightly ahead of schedule. That project will provide a welcome boost for oil and gas producers in the region as well as its developers. Image source: Getty Images. Kinder Morgan announced that its GCX pipeline began full commercial service this week, which is slightly ahead of the initial view that it would start up in October. As a result, the pipeline will now be able to transport up to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of gas from the Permian to Texas Gulf Coast markets. That\\'s a significant amount of new capacity for a region that currently produces 10 Bcf/d, though a small fraction of the need given that output is on track to top 21 Bcf/d by 2025.  The incremental gas shipping capacity from GCX will provide some relief for producers in the Permian Basin. Large-scale drillers like Apache (NYSE: APA) and Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: PXD), for example, will now be able to ship more of their gas to higher-priced Gulf Coast markets. That will enable them to earn some incremental cash flow. Pioneer\\'s CEO Scott Sheffield made a note of this impact on the company\\'s second-quarter call. He said: Once Gulf Coast Express comes on in the fourth quarter, we will move about 300 million cubic feet a day to the Gulf Coast and price that on a Ship Channel price index. And at that point, virtually all of our gas will be sold outside of the Permian Basin. Even drillers that didn\\'t sign up for space on this pipeline will benefit. That\\'s because it will help ease the region\\'s gas glut, which should boost prices. That will enable them to stop flaring their gas, allowing them to make some money on a commodity they were previously wasting. Image source: Getty Images. The pipeline\\'s investors -- Kinder Morgan, DCP Midstream (NYSE: DCP), Targa Resources (NYSE: TRGP), and Apache\\'s midstream arm Altus Midstream (NASDAQ: ALTM) -- will also benefit from the project\\'s completion. They\\'ll collect a share of the steady fees this system produces from the long-term contracts backing the project. Among the biggest beneficiaries will be Altus Midstream. The company currently expects to generate between $70 million and $85 million of adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) this year. However, after only producing $16.3 million of adjusted EBITDA during the first half, this forecast implies that Altus will experience a significant earnings jump in the back half of the year. That\\'s due in large part to the completion of GCX.  DCP Midstream and Targa Resources, meanwhile, will enjoy an additional boost in their gas gathering and processing (G&P) operations. These companies buy raw gas directly from producers that they then process and sell to end users. GCX will not only boost regional gas prices but also enable them to get more of this gas to higher-priced Gulf Coast markets, which should enhance the profitability of their G&P operations. Targa Resources\\' CEO Job Bob Perkins pointed out this positive impact on his company\\'s second-quarter call. That\\'s why his company is \"greatly looking forward to GCX coming online, and we will see higher Waha prices (the Permian\\'s gas hub), which will benefit us on the equity side of our volumes.\" The completion of the GCX pipeline will provide some much-needed relief to producers in the Permian. It will not only enable them to ship more gas to higher-priced Gulf Coast markets, but it will also help boost depressed regional prices. Meanwhile, it will be a boon to the pipelines\\' investors, too. They\\'ll enjoy its steady cash flow and the impact higher prices will have on their gathering and processing operations. GCX is just one of many new Permian pipelines on the way. Kinder Morgan expects to finish its Permian Highway pipeline next year, while another developer recently approved the Whistler Pipeline. Meanwhile, Kinder Morgan also has Permian Pass in development. Given this large slate of new pipelines, it seems like the Permian\\'s gas infrastructure problems are a thing of the past.  10 stocks we like better than ApacheWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But Rivian Automotive? What the heck is that? By the time 2020 is out, I suspect absolutely no one will be asking this question. If you haven\\'t heard of Rivian Automotive yet, here\\'s a quick rundown. Image source: Rivian Automotive. Based in Plymouth, Michigan, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence Rivian Automotive set up shop back in 2009 (although we didn\\'t start hearing a lot about it until just last year). The company hasn\\'t begun operations yet, really, but plans to begin selling its first two electric trucks, the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV, in late 2020. Kelley Blue Book advises that both models will seat at least five passengers, with the R1S having an optional three-row, seven-passenger configuration. As all-electric vehicles, they will not have a gas engine -- but may not need one to allay consumers\\' range anxiety, because both vehicles will be rated for between 300 and 410 miles fully charged. \\xa0 Because they\\'re trucks, they\\'ll boast significant towing capacity -- 11,000 pounds for the R1T and 7,700 pounds for the R1S. And because they\\'re electric, they\\'ll be able to go really fast when not towing a boat or camper -- accelerating from 0 to 60 in as little as three seconds. Neither truck will be cheap. Rivian expects to price the R1T at $69,000 to start, and the R1S at $72,500, both prices before state and federal tax credits. Now admittedly, none of this information will make much difference to consumers (or investors) if Rivian goes bust, or fails to produce the products it\\'s promised. But recent financing rounds suggest that Rivian will in fact have the cash it needs to go the distance. Last year, for example, Rivian attracted a $700 million investment from a consortium led by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which later awarded Rivian a contract to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans specially designed for Amazon\\'s use. (Deliveries will begin in 2020 or 2021, and continue through 2024). \\xa0 In swift succession, Rivian won a further $500 million investment from a company you\\'d think would consider it a rival -- Ford -- and $350 million from privately held Cox Automotive. Those investments alone probably would have been enough to make Rivian a viable contender to Tesla, which has an SUV of its own on the market already (Model X), and announced an electric pickup truck offering in November (Cybertruck). But in the waning days of December, Rivian won an even bigger investment -- more money than Ford and Amazon ponied up, combined. On Monday, December 23, Rivian announced it had secured a $1.3 billion investment from \"funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.\" With that money in hand, Rivian ended the year with nearly $3 billion in new funding. Given that the company already has a production plant to build in (Mitsubishi\\'s old plant in Normal, Illinois), $3 billion should be just enough cash to develop the three closely related truck/van models revealed so far. According to autoblog.com, the average cost to develop new cars is about $1 billion per model. \\xa0 Of course, the question still remains: Will Rivian\\'s trucks sell? According to Wall Street Journal auto reporter Dan Neil, \"we are living through the S-curve of EV adoption,\" and 2020 could very well become the year of the electric \"car.\" That being said, there are going to be a lot of electric cars coming to market this year to choose from, with more than a dozen new models coming on line to compete with existing fare such as Tesla\\'s Models S, 3, and X and Nissan\\'s Leaf. \\xa0 Although it\\'s hard to keep track of all the moving parts, WSJ alone highlights Volvo\\'s XC40 Recharge, Ford\\'s Mustang Mach-E, and Mini\\'s Mini Cooper SE as viable contenders in addition to Tesla\\'s and Nissan\\'s wares. At starting prices ranging from $60,500 (Ford) to just $30,750 (Mini), each of these new rivals underprices Rivian\\'s offering. \\xa0 One thing Rivian has got, however, that everyone else has not: Last week, Rivian released a video demonstrating its new \"tank turn\" feature that will be available for both the R1T and R1S. Like a modern main battle tank, the truck\\'s four electric motors can spin in different directions, enabling the truck to literally turn on a dime -- spinning itself around a fixed point. \\xa0 Probably thought up as a way to market the truck to off-roaders initially, this feature would also make Rivian\\'s truck incredibly maneuverable in tight spaces, such as might be encountered on construction sites, in crowded driveways, and parking garages -- the latter perhaps a valuable selling point to suburban shoppers. Combined with the right software, I suspect Rivian\\'s tank-turn feature will also make parallel parking in even the tightest spaces a breeze. Long story short, yes, this truck will sell. Now, all Rivian needs to do is build it.  10 stocks we like better than\\xa0WalmartWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have an investing tip, it can pay to listen.

An investment of just $100 per month at an annualized return of 12% over 50 years can grow to $3.9 million.\\xa0 Three stocks that can help you achieve those returns are\\xa0Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Here\\'s why these stocks should remain compounding machines for the next 50 years. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet\\'s Google is still benefiting from the shift of ad spending moving online. Its range of products and platforms, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Google Maps, and Gmail, each have over one billion users.\\xa0That\\'s attractive to advertisers, and it\\'s why Google is the No. 3 most valuable brand in the world, according to Brand Finance.\\xa0 However, over the next 50 years, Alphabet will likely generate significant amounts of revenue from other businesses. The one analysts are watching heading into 2020 is Google Cloud.\\xa0Google\\'s \"other revenue\" that includes Google Cloud, Google Play, Google Home, and other hardware products has been Alphabet\\'s fastest-growing segment in the last few years, and it may reach 20% of the company\\'s total revenue in 2020.\\xa0 There are not many companies as forward-thinking as Alphabet that have the resources to invest billions in new growth avenues. The company considers its investments in moonshot opportunities, or \"other bets,\" as vital to its future success.\\xa0These other bets include potential world-changers, such as self-driving cars with Waymo, or growth opportunities in life sciences with Verily.\\xa0 Don\\'t let Alphabet\\'s $992 billion market cap make you think the stock has already run its course.\\xa0The company has more than doubled its revenue and earnings over the last five years,\\xa0and given its forward-thinking corporate culture, Alphabet should continue to grow for many years. Moving one spot below Google on Brand Finance\\'s most valuable brand list is Microsoft, at No. 4.\\xa0The software giant has been making essential tools for people to get stuff done for decades. Microsoft has over 900 million Windows 10 users.\\xa0Under CEO Sadya Nadella, the company has spread its reach well beyond the PC to mobile devices and the cloud. Microsoft has the brand recognition, network effect advantage, and resources to continue winning in the markets it serves. Its Office software is still in high demand after all these years. Even though Apple\\xa0has 1.4 billion users of its devices,\\xa0the familiarity people have with Apple\\'s software hasn\\'t dethroned Microsoft\\'s Word and Excel. Office commercial products, including 365 subscriptions, have been growing fast, up 25% year over year in the most recent quarter.\\xa0 Also, businesses are continuing to use cloud-based tools to handle IT services. The infrastructure-as-a-service cloud market is expected to grow three times faster than traditional IT services through 2022, according to Gartner.\\xa0Microsoft Azure has tremendous momentum in this space, with revenue surging 59% year over year in the last quarter.\\xa0 Microsoft has proven it can adapt its basic software services to the cloud and develop new cloud-based platforms for businesses, such as Dynamics 365 and Azure.\\xa0The ability to adapt to changing environments in technology gives me confidence that the company will still be around in 50 years. It offers good growth prospects, high margins,\\xa0and a growing stream of dividends. Owning the stock seems like a no-brainer for the 21st\\xa0century. Tesla Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Tesla is not short of investor attention. The stock has experienced a meteoric rise since its initial public offering in 2010, but the sky truly is the limit for Elon Musk\\'s company. Some on Wall Street are debating whether it\\'s time to sell the stock after the share price more than doubled off of its lows last year.\\xa0But I think long-term investors should stay the course, and if you don\\'t already own shares, you should consider starting a small position. Tesla is at the center of a secular trend sweeping the world, as alternative forms of energy are increasingly in demand for everything from how homes are built to what fuels our cars. Tesla is known for its Model S, Model X, and Model 3 electric vehicles, but it defines its mission as helping the world accelerate to sustainable energy through various energy products, including solar electricity.\\xa0The company has installed thousands of solar products for consumers since 2006, and last year, it released Version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.\\xa0 You can\\'t underestimate a visionary leader like Musk, who has demonstrated a great talent for seeing an opportunity and starting a business to capture it.\\xa0As Tesla approaches a $100 billion market cap,\\xa0the company still has a tiny share of the nearly 100 million vehicles shipped in the industry every year.\\xa0There were about 367,500 Tesla vehicles delivered in 2019, for an increase of 50% year over year.\\xa0That growth is thanks to the Model 3, which went into production in 2017 and comes at a much more affordable price for the masses.\\xa0 However, Musk believes the upcoming Model Y will outsell the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 combined.\\xa0As Tesla releases more models, builds Gigafactories around the world,\\xa0increases scale, and brings prices down for these cars,\\xa0it\\'s inevitable the company will hit the one-million delivery mark at some point. There is enormous upside for the Tesla brand over the next 50 years. All three stocks are already large caps, but each could keep heading higher from here. Consider that\\xa0Coca-Cola\\xa0started in 1886,\\xa0but the stock is still increasing in value for shareholders.\\xa0Walt Disney\\xa0was started in 1923,\\xa0but the stock is up 355% over the last 10 years. Great growth stocks continue to find ways to deliver returns for shareholders, and I believe Alphabet, Microsoft, and Tesla will be no different.  10 stocks we like better than MicrosoftWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Pioneer Natural Resources Co will pay its semi-annual dividend of $0.44 on 1/14/20, Enerplus Corp will pay its monthly dividend of $0.01 on 1/15/20, and Vermilion Energy Inc will pay its monthly dividend of $0.23 on 1/15/20.  \\n\\nAs a percentage of PXD's recent stock price of $152.38, this dividend works out to approximately 0.29%, so look for shares of Pioneer Natural Resources Co to trade 0.29% lower — all else being equal — when PXD shares open for trading on 12/30/19.

Cohen remained in the top spot, and brought in new management to help him steer the company. His success has been impressive. The self-made man from Great Neck, New York has built Point72 into a giant of the hedge fund industry, with over $75 billion in total assets under management. That figure includes more than $19 billion worth of stock holdings, reported quarterly on the 13F forms, which draw the attention of investors everywhere. What’s drawn our attention are three holdings that Cohen boosted into the $85 to $99 million range. The large purchases caught our eye, and we ran the stocks through the TipRanks Stock Screener – all three have a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating and over 20% upside potential. That alone would be enough to attract the attention of a major fund, but we’ve taken a deeper dive to find out what else makes these stocks so compelling. First on the list is a Texas oil company. Pioneer operates in the Permian Basin of West Texas, one of the world’s largest oilfields, and has over 1 billion proven barrels of recoverable oil equivalent. The breakdown in the company’s reserves is 53% oil, and the rest split evenly between natural gas and usable natural gas liquids. In production terms, Pioneer put out 319 thousand barrels per day in 2018. Falling fuel prices have hurt PXD in recent months, despite solid growth in production. In the Q3 report, the company detailed a 9% year-over-year production gain, to 351 barrels per day. At the same time, revenues slipped 6%, to $2.33 billion, on lower oil and natural gas prices. Earnings, while down year-over-year, beat the forecast and came in at $1.99 per share. The earnings result was considered a minor win, as it allows the company to sustain both its modest quarterly dividend of 22 cents per share and its high rate of free cash flow. Looking ahead, Pioneer expects higher production in Q4, from new wells and gas processing plants that came online this year, and full-year cash flow of $3.4 billion, more than enough to fully fund all planned capital expenditures. So, in PXD, we have an oil company with valuable assets in a necessary industry, with a clear path to maintaining both output and extraction infrastructure improvement. These are attributes which easily explain Point72’s purchase of 686,750 shares in PXD. The fund’s purchase brings its total holding in Pioneer to 696,668 shares, worth $89.06 million as of the close of trading Friday. Wall Street’s analysts would agree with Steven Cohen’s decision to purchase PXD. Writing from Susquehanna, Biju Perincheril sums up the company’s recent performance: “PXD had a solid quarter, highlighted by a modest oil/total production beat … on much lower capital spending. PXD continues to be one of our top ideas given a combination of free cash flow capacity, production growth, and inventory depth.” His Buy rating comes with a $183 price target, implying room for 43% growth to the upside. (To watch Perincheril’s track record, click here) RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold is also bullish on PXD, and writes that the company has plenty of potential: “PXD's production growth profile, balance sheet, and free cash flow generation are best-in-class and differentiate vs. peers. We expect PXD shares to outperform because of the good balance sheet and upside opportunity in its portfolio. The company has one of the largest and most contiguous acreage positions in the core of the Midland Basin (Permian).” Hanold set a $180 price target with his Buy rating, indicating confidence in a 41% upside for the stock. (To watch Hanold’s track record, click here) Pioneer maintains a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 10 recent ratings. These include 8 Buys and 2 Holds, giving a 4 to 1 advantage to the bulls. Share are trading at $127.84, so the $169 average price target suggests room for about 30% upside. (See PXD stock analysis on TipRanks) Like Pioneer, Restaurant Brands was formed in 2014. QSR is the result of a merger between Burger King, which needs no introduction, and Tim Horton’s, Canada’s most popular coffee shop and restaurant chain. The company also owns Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. QSR is the world’s fifth largest fast food chain, and saw $5.36 billion in revenue in fiscal 2018. Shares in QSR slipped at the end of October, after a mixed Q3 report, but have since regained the loss the stock was mostly flat in November. The disappointing aspect of the Q3 repot was a 1.4% year-over-year same-store sales decline in Tim Horton’s. Burger King and Popeyes both saw growth, with BK gaining on interest in the Impossible Whopper and Popeyes showing a 9.7% same-store sales increase. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.46 billion, just under the $1.47 billion forecast, while the 72-cent EPS met the estimates. The earnings report would not have made much of an impression if Tim Hortons didn’t make up 60% of the company’s overall revenue. The BK and Popeyes segments have been growing consistently since Q3 2018, and the stock has seen overall gains of 25% in 2019, matching the S&P 500 index for the year. Management is upbeat about plans to improve the Tim Hortons brand growth in coming months. QSR’s solid foundation and proven long-term growth convinced Cohen to boost his fund’s holding in this stock. Point72 disclosed a 903,767 share purchase of QSR in Q3. Timing is an important point here, as the fund bought the shares before the Q3 earnings were released, and the fund’s total holding in the stock has since lost $7 million. Point72 still holds $77.87 million in QSR, however; it will be interesting to see what the firm discloses on its next 13F. Analysts were cautious after the Q3 report, but still willing to rate the stock a Buy. Dennis Geiger of UBS wrote, “3Q call commentary focused on Tim Hortons (TH) comp weakness and plans to improve performance, while highlighting sustainability of Burger King and Popeyes strength… Strategic growth plans should support better results, but over time, and we believe many investors are likely to view a meaningful turnaround as a show-me story…” Geiger gave the stock a Buy rating and an $86 price target, suggesting a 31% upside. (To watch Geiger’s track record, click here) Barclays’ 5-star analyst Jeff Bernstein takes a bit less ambiguously bullish stance. He wrote, after investor meetings with company management, “QSR is a pure-play global franchisor of three powerful brands, with long-term global growth potential, led by international unit expansion. Otherwise, a ~100% franchise mix and elevated leverage supports a return of cash. A combination of global diversification, well-managed cost structure, and future M&A potential leaves us bullishly inclined.” Bernstein’s Buy rating comes with an $80 upside, showing room for a 22% upside. (To watch Bernstein’s track record, click here) QSR’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on an impressive 11 Buys, indicating confidence in the stock. Only two analysts rated it a hold, and even they see an upside to the stock. The average price target of $79 implies a 22% upside potential from the current share price of $65. (See QSR stock analysis on TipRanks) Our final stock on this list is another food service company. US Foods is a major distributor in the industry, providing well over 300,000 branded products to over a quarter million customers nationwide. The company’s clientele includes restaurants, healthcare facilities, hotels, schools, and government institutions. Feeding people is another necessity-driven business niche, and US Foods sees over $25 billion in annual revenue. Like QSR above, USFD has gained 25% this year. US Foods flat-out beat the Q3 earnings estimates, showing 65 cents in EPS and $6.53 billion revenue. The year-ago numbers were 55 cents and $6.15 billion – so this most recent quarter was sharp annual gain. The revenue and earnings gains fully justify Point72’s decision in Q2 to buy up more than 854,000 shares of the stock, bringing the fund’s total holding to 2,423,762 shares, worth $96.39 million. It was a 55% increase in Cohen’s holding of the stock. Evaluating US Foods for Wells Fargo earlier this month, 4-star analyst Edward Kelly laid out a strong investment thesis: “USFD, which is the No. 2 player in the consolidating food service industry, represents an attractive investment option, in our view. The company has hit the ground running since its May 2016 IPO, generating strong earnings growth and ramping up M&A, while making progress in deleveraging the balance sheet. Though USFD has struggled to execute more recently as operating headwinds in the industry have accelerated, we continue to believe the company's strategy overall is sound.” Kelly reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, while his $54 price target indicates an upside of 36%. (To watch Kelly’s track record, click here) Jefferies analyst Christopher Mandeville is also bullish on USFD, seeing the stock as well-positioned to survive an economic downturn. He writes, “We believe USFD’s diverse customer mix and greater exposure to Healthcare/Gov’t/Education vs. peers (~25% vs. ~17% SYY and ~13% PFGC) provide relative insulation in the event of a downturn given this segment’s long-term contracts and more consistent purchasing habits.” Mandeville sees a 23% upside to the stock, indicated by his Buy rating and $49 price target. (To watch Mandeville’s track record, click here.) US Foods has had fewer analyst reviews in the last three months than the other stocks on this list, but it still has 5 Buys opposed to just 1 Hold – giving it a consensus rating of Strong Buy. Shares were trading for $39.77 at Friday’s close, and the $48.83 price target suggests an upside of 22%.

Three of IYE's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Transocean Ltd (Symbol: RIG), Pioneer Natural Resources Co (Symbol: PXD), and ConocoPhillips (Symbol: COP). Although RIG has traded at a recent price of $4.98/share, the average analyst target is 75.10% higher at $8.72/share. Similarly, PXD has 44.61% upside from the recent share price of $127.84 if the average analyst target price of $184.87/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting COP to reach a target price of $76.22/share, which is 27.16% above the recent price of $59.94.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Including the stock's intraday 6.4% gain as of 11:15 a.m. EST on Wednesday, shares are up more than 140% over the past four months. The stock's sharp gain on Wednesday follows yet another analyst's decision to increase his 12-month price target for the electric-car maker's stock ahead of earnings on Jan. 29. Model 3. Image source: Tesla. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to investors on Wednesday that he believes the company's fourth-quarter earnings and its guidance for vehicle deliveries will not disappoint investors when Tesla reports results later this month. He believes there's robust demand for vehicles in China and Europe. Further, he is particularly bullish on the company's opportunity in China following the start of production at the company's Shanghai factory earlier this year. The opportunity for Tesla in the China market is worth $100 to $300 per share, Ives estimates. The analyst boosted his price target for the stock to $550 -- up from a $370 price target previously. The analyst has a neutral rating on the stock. In addition to reporting its financial results for its fourth quarter on Jan. 29, Tesla will also likely provide guidance for vehicle deliveries in 2020. The automaker saw deliveries rise 50% year over year in 2019, and investors are expecting more sharp growth this year.
